My hopes of this experience is mainly to expand my knowledge of the affects biodiversity has upon an aquatic ecosystem. Through my internship at the VA Aquarium I looked at the carbon cycle on a large scale (salt and fresh water,) but I haven't scaled down to a smaller aquatic area. With this experience I will be able to see the difference or similarities between these two experiences. With this comparison I will be able to grasp even more than what is actually given to me. Once done with this experience, I want to personally be able to have a basic knowledge of the differing carbon cycles and an understanding, personally, the difference/similarities of these ecosystems. I know there are a multitude of factors that take part in carbon cycling, so learning more will only expand my knowledge base for when I go on into graduate school for environmental conservation.
