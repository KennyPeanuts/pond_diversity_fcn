    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
<p>
  The learning objectives represent a set of skills that students are expected to develop through participation in this course.
</p>
<p>
Students will:
<ol>
  <li>be able to use primary scientific literature to develop knowledge and as a tool to formulate research questions.</li>
  <li>be able to translate research questions and basic knowledge into practical experimental designs.</li>
  <li>be able to perform appropriate lab and field techniques safely and effectively.</li>
  <li>be able to collect and organize original data for analysis and distribution.</li>
  <li>be able to communicate research goals and findings to a general and professional audience in written and verbal formats.</li>
 </ol>
</p>
 <h2>Course Requirements</h2>
 <p>
 These requirements represent the basic requirements for satisfactory completion of the course:
 </p>
 <ul>
   <li>Participation in weekly lab meetings.</li>
   <li>Completion of weekly lab and fieldwork assignments.</li>
   <li>Completion of weekly research progress reports and/or blog entries.</li>
   <li>Maintain collected data in an organized and accessible format.</li> 
   <li>Completion of a poster for submission to the Cook&ndash;Cole College of Arts and Sciences Research Showcase.</li>
   <li>Completion of a 2 page summary of your research experience.</li>
 </ul>

 <h3>Weekly Lab Meetings</h3>
 <p>
 The lab will meet together for one hour a week.  These weekly meetings will provide a forum to discuss lab business, relevant information from the literature, and recent findings from lab research. Lab members are expected to contribute to these meetings by making presentations, reading assigned materials, and participating in discussions.
 </p>

 <h3>Weekly Research Assignments</h3>
 <p>
 Assignment of research tasks for each week will take place during the weekly lab meeting.  Once assigned it is expected that lab members will conduct lab&ndash; and fieldwork independently.
 </p>

 <h3>Weekly Reports</h3>
 <h4>Reports</h4>
 <p>
 Each lab member is required to maintain a written description  of the progress of their research project.  This description is independent of the lab and field notebooks that are used for data collection.  These weekly reports should include a description of the assigned research tasks for the week and a brief summary of the results of each task including a summary of relvant data anlysis.
 </p>

 <h4>Lab Blog Posts</h4>
 <p>
 Occasionally lab members will be required to write up a part of their research for the lab blog.  Blog entries are intended for a general audience and are an opportunity to describe the work in the lab to a broader public audience.
 </p>

 <h3>Research Poster</h3>
 <p>
 Each lab member is required to create a poster for submission to the Cook&ndash;Cole College of Arts and Sciences Research Showcase.  This poster is the final report of the research project. More detailed instructions on poster design will be provided as the semester progresses.
 </p>

<h2>Evaluation</h2>
<p>
The evaluation of your performance in the course will be holisitc and based on your overall completion of the course requirements described above.  Each student will receive a written midterm evaluation but informal feedback will be given throughout the semester.  I encourage you to solicit feedback anytime you are unclear as to how well you are meeting a requirement.  This course expects a significant degree of independence and this extends to evaluation.  You are responsible for making sure that you are getting the feedback you need to accomplish your research and academic goals.
</p> 
  
<h2>General Expectations</h2>
<p>
  I will not tolerate any activities that show any level of disrespect toward other students, myself, or any other members of the Longwood or Farmville community.  
</p>
<p>
  I expect that all members of the lab will adhere to the <a href="http://www.longwood.edu/studentconduct/12021.htm">Longwood Honor Creed and Pledge</a> at all times.  If you are unclear on whether something is academically honest, be sure to ask.  No one will hold it against you if you try to clarify your understanding of academic integrity.
