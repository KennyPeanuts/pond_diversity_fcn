Carly Martin Spring 2013
During research next semester I hope to learn how to formulate interesting questions, develop plans for answering those questions, execute those plans, analyze what is learned in the process, and communicate the findings. When you conduct research, you are exploring questions for which you may not be sure answers even exist. For these and other reasons, research can be daunting but also very exciting and rewarding.  
	I want to be able to take the experiences and processes that I will have learned from the research, and apply it in my own classroom.  I am going to use this research opportunity to broaden my knowledge of science.  In addition, I will use this opportunity to learn different   procedures and adapt them for a high school science classroom.
