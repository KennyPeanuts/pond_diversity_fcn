    * For 0.14 N: 10 ml of Stock Thiosulfate solution (1.4N) --> 100 ml DI water
    * For 0.014 N: 1 ml of Stock Thiosulfate solution (1.4N) --> 100 ml DI water
    * For 0.0014 N: 100 ul of Stock Thiosulfate solution (1.4N) --> 100 ml DI water

* Potassium Iodate solution (0.01N)
    * 0.1780 g KIO3 --> 500ml DI 

## Calculations

    DO = (((R - Rblk) Vstd * Nstd * E)/(Rstd - Rblk) (Vb - Vreg)) - DOreg

where:

* DO = dissolved oxygen in ml/L
* R = sample titration buret reading (ml)
* Rblk = difference between 1st and 2nd blank titration buret readings (ml)
* Rstd = standardization titration buret reading (ml)
* Vstd = volume of KIO3 standard (ml)
* Vb = sample volume (ml)
* Vreg = volume of sample displaced by reagents (ml)
* Nstd = normality of KIO3 standard (eq/L)
* E = 5,598 ml O2 / equivalent 
* DOreg = oxygen added with reagents (ml) = 0.018 ml/L O2 per 1 ml of MnCl

## Procedure for 10 ml serum vials

### Sample Collection
1. Collect ~10 ml into volume calibrated serum vial by overfilling by 0.5X volume
2. Cap vial to get correct volume
2. Immediately add 85 ul of MnCl sol. and 85 ul of the NaOH/NaI sol. and cap
3. Shake and allow precip to form and settle 3X while keeping the bottle in the dark
4. Add 85 ul of 10N H2SO4 and shake
5. Titrate with sodium thiosulfate until pale yellow then add 1 drop starch sol. and titrate until blue color disappears

### Standardization of Sodium Thiosulfate
1. Add 200 ul of KIO3 sol. to serum vial
2. Nearly fill serum vial with DI Water
3. Add 85 ul of 10N H2SO4
4. Add 85 ul of NaOH/NaI sol.
5. Titrate with sodium thiosulfate until pale yellow then add 1 drop starch sol. and titrate until blue color disappears
6. Repeat 3 to 5 times and use mean in calculations

### Blank Determination
1. Add 200 ul KIO3 sol. to BOD bottle 
2. Nearly fill BOD bottle with DI Water
3. Add 85 ul of 10N H2SO4
4. Add 85 ul of NaOH/NaI sol. and mix
5. Add 85 ul of MnCl sol.
6. Titrate with sodium thiosulfate until pale yellow then add 1 drop starch sol. and titrate until blue color disappears
7. Add 200 ul KIO3 sol.
8. Titrate with sodium thiosulfate until pale yellow then add 1 drop starch sol. and titrate until blue color disappears
9. Calculate difference between 1st and 2nd titrations as Rblk (this may be negative)

## Procedure for 300 ml BOD bottles

### Sample Collection 
1. Collect ~ 300 ml into volume calibrated BOD bottle
2. Immediately add 2.5 ml of MnCl sol. and 2.5 ml of the NaOH/NaI sol. and cap
3. Shake and allow precip to form and settle 3X while keeping the bottle in the dark
4. Add 2.5 ml of 10N H2SO4 and shake
5. Titrate with sodium thiosulfate until pale yellow then add 1 drop starch sol. and titrate until blue color disappears
