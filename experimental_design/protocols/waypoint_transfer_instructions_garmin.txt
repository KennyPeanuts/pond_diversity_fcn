How can I transfer waypoints using Homeport to an Excel spreadsheet?
HomePort trip planning software will allow the transfer of waypoints, routes and tracks to an Excel spreadsheet.

To transfer your waypoints, routes and tracks to an Excel spreadsheet:

Launch HomePort
Select the desired waypoints from My Collection/SD/Data Card
Export the file
Click File
Click Export
Click Export Selection
Select .GPX format as the file type for PC, or .CSV for a MAC
Select a destination (ex. My Documents or Desktop) to save it to on PC or MAC
Click Save.
Launch Excel
Click File
Click Open
Open the saved .GPX file or the saved .CSV file.
If Excel indicates this is not a valid format and ask if you want to open, Select Yes.
Open the file in Excel using the option, "As an XML table."
Click Yes to the next prompt from Excel.
Once the selected file has been opened you will have an Excel spreadsheet with your exported information. The information will contain Latitude/Longitude and time stamp. If the waypoint was created while the chartplotter was connected to a transducer, the water depth and water temperature will also show.
