# Litter Flux Experiment Design
## Fall 2014
## Longwood University

### Questions

1. What is the rate of litter input for the sediments of small ponds?
2. How does litter input vary spatially within a pond?
3. Is spatial variation in litter input related to pond characteristics?
4. What plant species contribute to litter in each pond?

### Experimental Design
