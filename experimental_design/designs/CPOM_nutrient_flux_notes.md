## Notes on Design and Experiments

### Research Questions and Justification

* Does the CPOM of lake sediments aid in the sequestration of inorganic nutrients in man-made ponds.

* How does CPOM alter the flux of nutrients in the sediments
    a) The C:N and C:P of CPOM declines when it is incubated with inorganic nutrients (Tant et al 2013)
