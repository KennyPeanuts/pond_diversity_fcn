# Experimental Design for the CPOM Nutrient Flux Experiment

## Notes on Design and Experiments

* modified 6 June 2014 by KF

### Research Questions and Justification

#### Goal

Understand the way in which litter decomposition contributes to the cycling of nutrients of man-made pond and their watersheds.

#### Research Questions

1. What is the fate of the organic nutrients in leaf litter during the decomposition process in man-made ponds?

2. How does the input of terrestrial detritus alter the sensitivity of pond metabolism to nutrient enrichment?


#### Objectives and Hypotheses

1. Quantify the effect of CPOM on sediment nutrient cycling.

    * H1: Sediments with CPOM will have a net influx of inorganic N and P into the sediments from the water column due to the immobilization of inorganic N and P in the fungal and bacterial biomass on the CPOM, while sediments without CPOM will have a net flux of inorganic N and P out of the water column.

    * H2: Sediments with CPOM will have a net flux of DOM out of the sediments due to the leaching of DOM from the leaves.

    * H3: Sediments with CPOM will have greater SOD due to the respiration of the fungal and bacterial communities on the leaves. 

    * H4 Sediments with CPOM will not increase in the percent organic matter of the FPOM because leaf mass is mainly being lost as CO_2 and DOM.

2. Quantify how CPOM alters heterotrophic microbial biomass and metabolism.

    * H1: Sediments with CPOM will increase water column bacterial abundance due to the production of DOM from leaf leaching.

    * H2: The water exposed to CPOM will have greater water column respiration due to the increase in leachate from the leaves.

    * H3: CPOM particles will have greater fungal biomass than fine sediments.

3. Quantify how CPOM alters the response of sediment metabolism to nutrient enrichment.

    * H1: Sediments with CPOM will have an increase in inorganic N and P flux into the sediments when exposed to elevated inorganic N and P due to nutrient limitation in the fungi growing on the leaves.

    * H2: CPOM mass loss will be greater with elevated inorganic N and P due to nutrient limitations on the leaf associated fungi.

    * H3: Sediments with CPOM will have greater SOD when exposed to elevated inorganic N and P due to greater respiration by leaf associated fungi.

    * H4: The water oxygen consumption will be greater in the treatments with elevated N and P.

    * H4: Water column bacteria biomass will increase more following fertilization with inorganic N and P in sediments with CPOM due to the ability of the bacteria to balance the stoichiometry of leaf produced DOM.


### Experimental Design

|         | Ambient Nutrient | N + P Addition |
| :------ | :--------------: | :------------: |
| No CPOM |                4 |              4 |
| CPOM    |                4 |              4 |


* pond sediments - CPOM = sediments passed through a 250um mesh to remove all CPOM and macroinvertebrates.  

* pond sediments + CPOM 0.5 mg CPOM/jar = 0.16 g/m^2

* N + P addition = 2X ambient N & P


#### Response 

* N & P concentration

* bottle SOD 

* water respiration
 
* absorbance

* 3-D fluorometry

* bacterial biomass

* fungal biomass (Ergosterol)

* LOI of CPOM

#### Sample Number Calculations

* CPOM levels = 2

* Nutrients levels = 2 

* Replicates/level = 4

* Weeks = 4

* Sed O2 Conc. Samples = 14
    * Week 1 = 8
    * Weeks 2:4 = 2/week = 6 

* Water O2 Conc. Samples = 7
    * Week 1 = 4
    * Weeks 2:4 = 1/week = 3

* Nutrient/Abs/Bacteria Samples = 7 
    * Week 1 = 4
    * Weeks 2:4 = 1/week = 3

* Ergosterol/AFDM Samples = 1

* Jars needed = 2 CPOM * 2 Nutrients * 4 Replicates = 16

* Total Nutrient/Abs/Bacteria Samples = 16 Jars * 7 Samples = 112

* Total Ergosterol Samples = 16 Jars * 1 Sample = 16

#### Sample Volume Calculations



#### Methods Description

##### Set Up

* Sediment samples will be collected from a local man-made pond.  The sediments will be passed through a 250&mu; mesh to remove CPOM and macroinvertebrates.

* After allowing the mud to settle overnight and siphoning off the overlying water, 100 ml of sediments slurry will be placed into 300 ml BOD and the remaining volume will be filled with pond water collected at the same time as the sediments.

* CPOM treatments will be created by adding 0.5 mg dry mass of tulip poplar leaf disks to the surface of the sediments from tulip poplar leaved collected immediately after senescence, air dried, and then conditioned for 24 hours in pond water.

* Elevated nutrient treatments will be created by adding NO3 and PO4 at 2X the concentration measured in the overlying water at the initiation of the experiment.

##### Nutrient, DOM, and Bacterial Sampling

* The jars will be incubated in darkness at room temperature for a total of 4 weeks.

* For each BOD jar + the refill water:

     * 30 ml of water will be removed and filtered through GFF and frozen to measure the nutrient concentration

     * 5 ml of water will be removed and filtered through a GFF and the absorbance will be measured on a nanopore spec.

     * 3 ml of water will be removed and preserved with gluteraldehyde for bacterial abundance.

* **Total Water Removed = 40 ml per BOD + 40 ml for refill water = 680 ml per sampling** 

##### SOD and Respiration Sampling

* Prior to the nutrient, DOM, and bacteria samples are collected 
   
    * 15 ml of water will be collected from each BOD jar and the refill water into a 10 ml vial and fixed immediately for the T-0 SOD and water respiration measurement
 
    * Another 15 ml of water will be collected into a 10 ml vial and incubated in the dark for the T-1 water respiration measurement

* The SOD bottles will then be refilled with 90 ml of pond water (40 ml from nut samp. + 30 ml from resp + 15 ml from prev. resp + 5 ml overflow) and sealed.

* After a 5 h incubation in the dark, 15 ml of water will be collected from the BOD bottle into a 10 ml vial and fixed for T-1 SOD measurement

* At the same time the vial of incubating water will be fixed for the T-1 water respiration measurement.

* For the remaining 4 weeks, each jar will be sampled once a week.

* **Total Water Removed = 30 ml per BOD + 15 ml for refill water = 495 ml per sampling**

    * the BOD jars will have 185 ml prior to sampling so the 70 ml removed per jar is 38% of the volume of the overlying water.

* **Total Water Needed for Replacement = 90 ml * 16 jars * 7 sampling dates = 10080 ml + (55 ml * 7 sampling dates) = 10465 ml total** 

##### Fungal Biomass and CPOM  AFDM.

* At the conclusion of the experiment, 
    
    * 3 leaf disks will be placed into 10 ml of methanol for ergosterol extraction.

    * 3 leaf disks will be ashed for AFDM.

    * 10 ml of sediment will be dried and ashed for FPOM AFDM
