# Experimental Design for the CPOM Nutrient Flux Experiment

## Notes on Design and Experiments

### Research Questions and Justification

#### Goal

Understand the way in which litter decomposition contributes to the cycling of nutrients of man-made pond and their watersheds.

#### Research Questions

1. What is the fate of the organic nutrients in leaf litter during the decomposition process in man-made ponds?

2. How does the input of terrestrial detritus alter the sensitivity of pond metabolism to nutrient enrichment?


#### Objectives and Hypotheses

1. Quantify the effect of CPOM on sediment nutrient cycling.

    * H1: Sediments with CPOM will have a net influx of inorganic N and P into the sediments from the water column due to the immobilization of inorganic N and P in the fungal and bacterial biomass on the CPOM, while sediments without CPOM will have a net flux of inorganic N and P out of the water column.

    * H2: Sediments with CPOM will have a net flux of DOM out of the sediments due to the leaching of DOM from the leaves.

    * H3: Sediments with CPOM will have greater SOD due to the respiration of the fungal and bacterial communities on the leaves. 

    * Sediments with CPOM will not increase in the percent organic matter of the FPOM because leaf mass is mainly being lost as CO_2 and DOM.

2. Quantify how CPOM alters heterotrophic microbial biomass.

    * H1: Sediments with CPOM will increase water column bacterial abundance due to the production of DOM from leaf leaching.

    * H2: CPOM particles will have greater fungal biomass than fine sediments.

3. Quantify how CPOM alters the response of sediment metabolism to nutrient enrichment.

    * H1: Sediments with CPOM will have an increase in inorganic N and P flux into the sediments when exposed to elevated inorganic N and P due to nutrient limitation in the fungi growing on the leaves.

    * H2: CPOM mass loss will be greater with elevated inorganic N and P due to nutrient limitations on the leaf associated fungi.

    * H3: Sediments with CPOM will have greater SOD when exposed to elevated inorganic N and P due to greater respiration by leaf associated fungi.

    * H4: Water column bacteria biomass will increase more following fertilization with inorganic N and P in sediments with CPOM due to the ability of the bacteria to balance the stoichiometry of leaf produced DOM.


### Experimental Design

|         | Ambient Nutrient | N + P Addition |
| :------ | :--------------: | :------------: |
| No CPOM |                5 |              5 |
| CPOM    |                5 |              5 |


* pond sediments - CPOM = sediments passed through a 250um mesh to remove all CPOM and macroinvertebrates.  Also an equivilent amount of sediment to equal the OM added from the CPOM will be added.

* pond sediments + CPOM 0.5 mg CPOM/jar = 0.16 g/m^2

* N + P addition = 2X ambient N & P


#### Response 

* N & P concentration

* oxygen concentration
 
* absorbance

* bacterial biomass

* fungal biomass (Ergosterol)

* LOI of CPOM

#### Sample Calculations

* CPOM levels = 2

* Nutrients levels = 2 

* Replicates/level = 5

* Weeks = 6

* Nutrient/Abs/Bacteria Samples = [Samples/Week1 = 5 + ((Samples/Weeks 2:6 = 1) * 5 Weeks) = 5] = 10

* Ergosterol/AFDM Samples = 1

* Jars needed = 2 CPOM * 2 Nutrients * 5 Replicates = 20

* Total Nutrient/Abs/Bacteria Samples = 20 Jars * 10 Samples = 200 

* Total Ergosterol Samples = 20 Jars * 1 Sample = 20


#### Methods Description

##### Set Up

* Sediment samples will be collected from a local man-made pond.  The sediments will be passed through a 250&mu; mesh to remove CPOM and macroinvertebrates.

* Approximately 4 cm sediments will then be placed into 300 ml septum topped glass jars and the remaining volume will be filled with pond water collected at the same time as the sediments.

* CPOM treatments will be created by adding 0.5 mg dry mass of tulip poplar leaf disks to the surface of the sediments from tulip poplar leaved collected immediately after senescence, air dried, and then conditioned for 24 hours in pond water.

* Elevated nutrient treatments will be created by adding NO3 and PO4 at 2X the concentration measured in the overlying water at the initiation of the experiment.

##### Sampling

* The jars will be incubated in darkness at room temperature for a total of 6 weeks.


* For the first week each jar will be sampled every 24 hours:

     * 25 ml of water will be removed and filtered through GFF and frozen to measure the nutrient concentration

     * 1 ml of water will be removed and filtered through a GFF and the absorbance will be measured on a nanopore spec.

     * 5 ml of water will be removed and filtered onto a black membrane filter and stained with DAPI for bacterial counts with epiflorescence.

     * SOD will be measured by refilling the jars with pond water and sealing them without air.
 
        * 15 ml samples will be taken after 1, 3, and 6h of dark incubation without introducing air into the jars.
 
        * the oxygen content of the sample will be determined with Winkler Titration.

* For the remaining 5 weeks, each jar will be sampled once a week.

* At the conclusion of the experiment, the fungal biomass on the CPOM will be determined using ergosterol extraction.

##### Timeline

* Early June 2014 - collect sediments and establish treatments

* June/ early July 2014 - sample experiment collect SOD data, collect absorbance data

* Fall 2014 - send off nutrients and ergosterol samples for measurement count bacteria samples

* Winter 2014/2015 - analyze data, begin manuscript preparation

* Spring 2015 - complete manuscript and present results at SFS
