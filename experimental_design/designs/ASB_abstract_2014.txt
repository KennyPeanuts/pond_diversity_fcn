Globally, man-made ponds and reservoirs approach the abundance of natural lentic systems.  Furthermore, in regions that lack natural lakes, man-made ponds tend to be the dominant lentic habitat. However, our knowledge of the ecology and biogeochemistry of man-made ponds lags behind that of natural systems. In natural ponds allochthonous detritus input can represent a substantial proportion of the total organic matter budget. The decomposition of this detritus supports macroinvertebrates and fuels production across trophic levels. Our project investigates whether the role and regulation of allochthonous litter decomposition in man-made ponds differs from this model. Spring sampling of 4 man-made ponds in central Virginia shows that the median coarse particulate organic matter (CPOM) pool, mainly comprised of allochthonous detritus, ranged 20 - 243 g m-2 and was variable among and within ponds. Comparison of CPOM density and the percent organic matter of the sediment, determined as loss on ignition at 550o C, shows a complex relationship between detritus input and sediment organic matter content. Direct measurement of decomposition using litter bags in 3 ponds during the fall and winter months showed similar mass losses across ponds. Unlike natural ponds, detrital mass loss appears to be due to microbial activity because virtually no shredding macroinvertebrates were recovered from the litter bags or the CPOM samples. These results suggest that the decomposition of allochthonous detritus is an important component of organic matter cycling in man-made ponds but that its regulation may rely on factors different from those identified from natural ponds.
