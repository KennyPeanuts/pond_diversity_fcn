# Evaluation for Research, Fall 2013
## Leanna

This is a written evaluation of your performance as a research student during the Fall 2013 semester.  This evaluation is to highlight the aspects of your work that I think is satisfactory or beyond expectations and to indicate areas where I think you can improve.  This evaluation is mainly give you an idea of my perception of your lab-work and is intended to be part of a conversation as you continue in the lab.  Please use this evaluation as a starting point for any questions you have about becoming a better student and scholar.  

I am making my observations from two perspectives.  The first is from the perspective of getting the lab projects completed efficiently and properly.  In this case I am considering your ability to work well with the rest of the team and to complete the work according to the established lab protocols.  In the second case I am considering your development as a professional scientist and scholar.  In this case I am evaluating your overall approach to being part of a research team. 

## Lab Work

Overall I am extremely pleased with your work in the lab.  Your work is consistent and careful.  I am glad to see you taking a leadership role in the lab and focussing on the big picture of keeping the projects moving forward.  I thought you handeled the unrest with Kasey with a lot of maturity and I appreciate you maintiaing your professionalism.  Finally, you are doing a good job of communicating lab business to me and keeping me up-to-date on what is going on in the lab, including the effective use of git and github.  Keep up the good work.

## Professional Development 

Your strengths in this area are that you have clearly taken ownership of the lab projects and seem to see yourself as part of the project and not just a worker in the lab.  This is really good, I would like to see you extend this approach to the field as a whole.  This semester I would like to see you work on developing your understanding of the overall science behind the work that we are doing in the lab.  This means searching for and reading more papers and thinking about the work that we are doing in a broader context of how the biosphere operates.  I am planning on having you do most of the preparation for the manuscript on your ethanol project so this will help frame your work overall.
