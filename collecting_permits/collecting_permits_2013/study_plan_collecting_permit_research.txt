This document describes the relevant components of a proposed Longwood University research project in the for the purpose of obtaining a collection permit.  

Purpose of the Project:
The purpose of the research is to investigate the relationship between sediment biodiversity the processing of sediment organic matter.

Collection Methods:
Benthic macroinvertebrates will be collected from the soft sediments of several small ponds in the vicinity of Farmville, VA using an Ekman dredge.  The exact ponds that will be sampled have not been determined yet.  

Data to be Collected:
The project aims to collect two forms of data.  The first is an estimate of the macroinvertebrate community composition, abundance, and functional diversity in the sediments of small ponds.  Samples collected for this purpose will be preserved in 70% ethanol for the sorting, identification, and enumeration of the invertebrates (mainly chironomid larvae).  The second type of data that we will collect is on the effect of benthic invertebrate diversity on the processing of organic carbon in the lake sediments.  In this case, the collected invertebrates will be sorted live and used in short-term sediment incubations before being preserved and counted. 

Proposed Quantity to be Collected:
It is difficult to estimate the number of organisms that will need to be collected to complete the goals of this study, as this will depend on the density and diversity of the sediment macroinvertebrates.  We plan to sample each lake with sufficient effort to get good coverage of the spatial and temporal variation in the sediment community. 

Disposition Method:
All preserved samples will be stored in 70% ethanol in the Fortino Lab at Longwood University.
