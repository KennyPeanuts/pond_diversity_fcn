<h1>The effect of coarse particulate organic matter on the rate of sediment organic matter processing in man&ndash;made ponds.</h1>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>
The number of man&ndash;made ponds have been increasing over the past few centuries as part of the overall influence of human land use changes.  In many regions, man&ndash;made ponds represent an abundant but novel aquatic habitat that can alter patterns of biodiversity and biogeochemistry.  Ponds are sites of organic matter accumulation but also active sites of decomposition, so they may represent a critical component in the carbon cycle.  The factors that regulate the accumulation and decomposition of organic matter in man&ndash;made ponds are virtually unstudied and likely differ from those factors identified from natural systems.  The proposed research project will focus on quantifying one aspect of organic matter accumulation and decomposition dynamics in man&ndash;made ponds.  The organic matter in ponds can be divided into a coarse and a fine fraction.  The coarse fraction is mainly the leaf litter of vascular plants and the fine fraction derives from the decomposition of the coarse fraction, as well as from algal production and sediment transport.  Previous work in my lab has shown that there is a correlation between the coarse and fine fractions but it is unknown how the presence of coarse organic matter affects the overall decomposition of sediment organic matter.  The proposed project will evaluate the relationship between coarse and fine organic matter using sediment incubation experiments that measure sediment oxygen demand.  These data will advance our understanding of how man&ndash;made ponds affect carbon cycling and climate change.
