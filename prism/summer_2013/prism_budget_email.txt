Dear Dr. Fortino,
 
I am writing to let you know that you have $1500 to buy supplies to support your LU-PRISM project.  Please contact Debbie Johnson (BES administrative assistant, johnsondm@longwood.edu, x2957) to get your supplies ordered.  I have copied her on this email.  Your supplies should be charged to the LU-PRISM budget (1-11017).  If you require additional funds, please let me know as they may be available.  It is important that these funds be spent quickly.  I am asking you to place orders with Mrs. Johnson no later than April 12th.  If you have not spent your funds by that date, the money will be returned to the LU-PRISM budget and allocated for other purposes.  If you have questions or concerns, please let me know.  Again, please place your orders ASAP.  Happy spending!!
 
Thanks!
Melissa
