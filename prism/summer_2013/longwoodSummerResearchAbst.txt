Understanding the factors that control carbon cycling is critical to understanding how ecosystems will respond to climate change.  One gap in our knowledge of carbon cycling is the role of small ponds in carbon dioxide production and organic carbon storage.  Small ponds can store large amounts of organic carbon in their sediments because they capture organic material from their watersheds.  If this carbon remains in the lake sediments, it can be subtracted from atmospheric carbon and may mitigate some of the effects of climate change.  However, if the organic carbon that gets washed into the lake is consumed by sediment microorganisms, the carbon will be returned to the atmosphere as carbon dioxide, potentially exacerbating climate change.  I am proposing a project to investigate the effect of biodiversity on the storage of organic carbon in the sediments of small ponds.  Preliminary data suggest that the functional diversity of sediment insect communities alter the rate at which the sediment microorganisms breakdown organic carbon.  The objective of the proposed project is to expand upon these preliminary findings and measure the effect of sediment-dwelling insect function diversity on the rate of sediment organic matter breakdown in the field.  We will manipulate the functional diversity of sediment insect communities in small chambers in the lake and quantify changes in sediment organic matter breakdown by calculating sediment oxygen demand. These findings will expand our knowledge of how potentially climate sensitive factors (insect community composition) control the storage of organic carbon in lake sediments.
