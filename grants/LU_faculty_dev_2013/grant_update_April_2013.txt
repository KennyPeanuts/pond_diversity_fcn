Dear Colleague,
 
Please forgive the quasi-anonymous nature of an email that is of deep concern to both of us.  I have just had a communication from the VPAA’s office which indicates a major roadblock for many of this year’s applicants, if you happen to be one of those putting in for a research/development grant after having received a prior award.  On page 125 of the FPPM (para. 6), it stipulates that recipients of research/development grants must file a written report of their grant activities with the VPAA’s Office and with the Committee.  “Faculty members who fail to submit such a written report will not be eligible to receive future grants.”
 
If you are a first-time applicant for a research/development grant, this does not affect you.  For many of the rest of you, I’ll bet you already see the problem.  These reports were due back on 1 September.  Rather than let a paperwork snafu derail many fabulous projects, we have asked for (and won) a small reprieve: you may stay in the running for your grant, pending the submission of the required report by this Friday.  This report need not be a black hole for your already overworked schedules.  It primarily needs to demonstrate the success of your prior grant (publications, lectures given, classroom implementation, publicity for LU, etc.).  For simplicity’s sake, I’ll accept email submissions on behalf of the committee.  Eva Philbeck will be the contact person for the VPAA’s office, and she also will accept email attachments.
 
I am, of course, at your disposal for any questions.  The good news in this business is the knowledge that the administration is about to give the official green light on this year’s awards.  Bon courage, as my French pals would say in this scenario.
