# Narrative Description of the Project

**The impact of biodiversity on ecosystem function: organic matter breakdown in pond sediments.**

## Rationale 

Human activities have resulted in dramatic changes to many of the Earth's ecosystem processes.  Forest clearing and the burning of fossil fuels have altered the carbon cycle and changed the climate (CITE).  Simultaneously human land-use has altered the distribution of many species and overall reduced the biodiversity of the Earth (CITE).  One striking example of a human activity that affects both biodiversity and carbon cycling is the construction of ponds.  The number of man-made ponds is increasing exponentially (Downing) and in regions without abundant natural lakes, such as Virgina, man-made ponds represent a dominant freshwater habitat.  Ponds are highly active sites of carbon breakdown but their effect on climate change and biodiversity is poorly understood. 

The proposed project will evaluate the impact of biodiversity on the breakdown of organic carbon in the sediments of man-made ponds.  This project is an expansion of the work that I began as part of my doctoral dissertation and through the proposed research I will continue my investigations into the factors controlling carbon cycling in aquatic systems.   This research will benefit the field of aquatic ecology, since man-made ponds are understudied systems (Tranvik et al. 2009) and the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning is a fundamental question in ecology and environmental science.  Addressing these questions through research done at Longwood University will contribute to the strong program in environmental science that is being developed in the Department of Biological and Environmental Sciences (BES).  BES has several faculty who specialize in aquatic systems, and thus the Department and the University have the potential to become a strong nucleus for aquatic biology and environmental science.  Establishing research projects in local systems will provide the foundation for the continued development of aquatic environmental science research at Longwood and provide opportunities for collaboration within BES and with researchers at other universities. 

The proposed project has been designed from the ground up to incorporate undergraduate research students.  The project builds off of preliminary research that was begun at DePauw University using only undergraduate researchers.  That summer project resulted in 2 student poster presentations at DePauw's Research Symposium and I will present the results at the national meeting of the Society for Freshwater Science this year.  The research described in this proposal is designed to lay the foundation of a research program that will provide extensive undergraduate research opportunities.  Furthermore the data collected during this project will be valuable for developing laboratories and classroom exercises for upper level ecology and environmental science courses in BES.

## Goals

The principle goal of the proposed research is to *elucidate the effect of insect functional diversity on organic carbon breakdown in the sediments of man-made ponds*.  The importance of biodiversity on ecosystem processes is a fundamental question in ecology and environmental science (CITE) and the role of man-made ponds in carbon cycling and climate change is poorly understood, despite their increasing abundance (CITE).  In order to evaluate the above goal, the project is divided into 2 objectives:

### Objective 1: Characterize the functional diversity of sediment insect communities in local ponds.

Pond sediments contain diverse communities of aquatic insects.  Prior work by myself and others have found that these aquatic insects interact with their environment in different ways producing functional diversity in addition to species diversity.  Objective 1 is designed to describe the patterns of functional diversity in the sediments of ponds near Longwood University.  The description of pond functional diversity will provide valuable information on the range of diversity in man-made ponds.  Furthermore, when correlated with data collected about the physical environment of the ponds, the characterization of the functional diversity will provide insight into the factors that control biodiversity in man-made systems.  Finally the characterization of pond functional diversity is essential for the development of the experiments in the second objective.  The data collected as part of objective 1 will be used to frame the hypotheses about how the observed functional diversity will affect sediment organic carbon breakdown (objective 2). 

### Objective 2: Test the effect of observed functional diversity on the breakdown of sediment organic carbon.

The research that I completed for my doctoral dissertation (CITE), as well as the work of other researchers (CITE) has shown that the rate of organic carbon breakdown in lake sediments in primarily controlled by factors local to the patch of sediment being observed (e.g., temperature, oxygen availability, etc...).  The activity of sediment insects can alter these local environmental factors and affect the rate of organic carbon breakdown in the sediments where they occur (CITE).  Most of the previous work on the effect of sediment-dwelling insects on sediment function has only evaluated the effect of a single insect species or group.  Preliminary results collected on ponds in Indiana indicate that insects in different functional groups can differ in their effects on sediment organic carbon breakdown.  The experiments associated with this objective are designed to explicitly evaluate the effects of the interactions between insects in functionally diverse sediment communities.  There is very little existing research on how interactions between sediment-dwelling insects affect ecosystem processes, especially in man-made ponds.  The data collected through this objective will provide essential information on how the insect communities of man-made ponds alter their role in carbon cycling and climate change.

Taken together the two objectives of my goal of elucidating the effect of insect functional diversity on organic carbon breakdown in man-made ponds, will provide valuable information about the biodiversity and function of man-made ponds in the southeast, a region virtually devoid of natural ponds and lakes.  Furthermore, the results of these objectives will inform our understanding of the role of man-made ponds in a changing climate.

## Subjects

The only organisms used in this research will be the sediment-dwelling macroinvertebrates collected from the pond sediments.  Upon completion of the proposed collections or experiments, all organisms will be sacrificed and preserved in 70% ethanol.

## Procedures

### Objective 1: Characterize the functional diversity of sediment insect communities in local ponds.

I propose to characterize the functional diversity of sediment insect communities of 3 - 6 local ponds in the vicinity of Longwood University.  The exact number of ponds used will depend on the density and diversity of the communities that we find and thus, the amount of time required to process the samples.  At a minimum we will sample Wilck's Lake - located in Wilck's Lake park on Third St. in Farmville, and 2 ponds located in the wetland area associated with Lancer Park.  These 3 ponds will provide a gradient in size and degree of human impact. Sediment insect communities will be collected from a representative sample of habitat locations within each pond throughout the year.  Sediment collection will begin this spring as part of the research responsibilities of 2 research (BIO 496/497) students working in my lab and continue approximately monthly through the year.

In each pond the sediment animal communities will be sampled using an Ekman dredge.  The collected sediments will be washed through a 250&mu;m mesh net to remove excess sediments and the remaining sample will be preserved in 70% ethanol.  Preserved insects will be sorted from the surrounding sediment and counted using a dissecting microscope.  My lab is already equipped to collect and sort the sediment insects.  However, to identify the insects and assign them to functional groups we will need to mount the insects on microscope slides and observe them using a compound light microscope.  The proposed budget contains money to acquire a microscope and a portion of the lab consumables budget will be for the mounting materials.  In addition to the insect collections, basic environmental information will be collected from each pond on each sampling date.  

### Objective 2: Test the effect of observed functional diversity on the breakdown of sediment organic carbon.

To test the effect of functional diversity on the breakdown of sediment organic carbon, I will conduct a series of sediment incubation experiments.  Sediment microbes convert organic carbon into CO~2~  and consume oxygen.  Therefore, sediment oxygen demand (SOD) is a measure of the amount of sediment organic carbon breakdown.  Experiments will be conducted in containers (approx. 500 ml) containing lake sediments and overlying water from the lake.  In these containers I will manipulate functional diversity and measure SOD.

Sediment oxygen demand measurements will use the Winkler titration method (CITE).  To perform Winkler titrations I will need the digital buret, reagents, and biological oxygen demand (BOD) bottles indicated in the budget.  Furthermore, the budget contains money for the construction of the incubation chambers.  These chambers are constructed from mason jars that have been modified to allow for the removal of water samples without the introduction of air.

### Timeline for Completion of the Project

The lake sampling to characterize the functional diversity of the sediment community will begin this spring and continue for approximately 1 year to fully capture the seasonal dynamics of the system, however a rather thorough understanding of the functional diversity of the system will likely be complete by the end of the summer of 2013.  The SOD experiments will be conducted during the summer of 2013 with a summer research student from the PRISM program.  The analysis of the experiments will be complete by the end of the summer of 2013 and the manuscript preparation will begin during the fall of 2014 with plans to submit a for publication by the end of the 2013.  Since this project is designed to provide a foundation for continuing studies of the interaction between biodiversity and ecosystem function in ponds, new project planning based on the findings of the summer of 2013 will begin during the fall of 2013.     

## Expected Outcomes

The principle expected outcome of this project is the establishment of a program of research in pond biodiversity and biogeochemistry that will provide scholarly opportunities for myself and research opportunities for Longwood students.  The materials requested in this proposal will provide my lab with the equipment needed to train research students and develop collaborations with researchers both at Longwood and other universities.

## Current Status of the Project

The proposed project builds off of work that I conducted as part of my doctoral dissertation, as well as a research project performed at DePauw University.  My dissertation research found that the major factors affecting organic carbon breakdown in lake sediments were temperature and oxygen availability.  My work at DePauw showed different functional groups of insects (predators and collectors) varied in their effect on SOD.  Collector insects increased SOD in the sediments of a shallow quarry pond, while there was no effect of the presence of predatory insects.  These results are intriguing because they suggest that alterations to the insect community can affect the ability of ponds to store organic carbon in their sediments, however these results are from a unique system (a shallow quarry pond) and may not be representative of more typical man-made ponds.  I am working with 2 research students this spring to initiate the pond sampling and one of these students will likely be continuing to work on this project this summer as part of the PRISM program.

## Personnel

Most of the techniques required for the completion of this project were utilized in the completion of my dissertation research.  I have approximately 13 years of experience performing research in aquatic systems.  Furthermore, I have experience collecting and identifying aquatic insects from the southeastern United States.

## Budget

The acquire the materials needed for the completion of this project I will need $8300.  The majority of the budget is for the compound microscope needed to identify the insects collected from the pond sediments.  The remaining items will be used to set up the necessary apparatus to incubate the sediments and measure SOD.  The digital burette, BOD bottles, and reagents are needed for the Winkler titration.
