## Central Question:

What is the effect of leaf litter on pelagic primary production in ponds?

### Objective

1) Quantify phytoplankton nutrient limitation in small man-made ponds in central Virginia.

    i) H1: Phytoplankton productivity will be more nutrient limited in ponds with high leaf litter density.

2) Quantify the effect of terrestrial leaf litter on the nutrient limitation of phytoplankton in small ponds. 

    i) H1: Leaf litter will increase phytoplankton nutrient limitation due to nutrient immobilization from the sediments.
