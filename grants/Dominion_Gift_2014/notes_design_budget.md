# Notes on the design and budget for the Dominion Gift

## Plan

The plan is to establish a permanent field site at North Campus for the study of atmosphere-water-land interactions.  The site will have equipment for remote data collection as well as permanent plots that will be sampled repeatedly.

The plan also includes specifications for data storage and accessibility. All of the data will be publicly available and a selection of the data will be displayed in real time in campus locations (e.g., Environmental Center and the Hall TVs in Chichester).
