## Notes on Design and Experiments

### Research Questions and Justification

#### Goal

Understand the way in which man-made ponds contribute to the processing of watershed organic matter and nutrients.

#### Research Questions

1. How does the input of terrestrial detritus affect the nutrient retention or release from the sediments of man-made ponds?

2. How does the input of terrestrial detritus alter the sensitivity of pond metabolism to nutrient enrichment?


#### Objectives and Hypotheses

1. Quantify the effect of CPOM on the flux of nutrients across the sediment water interface.

    * H1: CPOM will result in an increase in N and P flux into the sediments.

    * H2: CPOM will result in an increase in DOC flux out of the sediments.

    * H3: CPOM will result in an increase in SOD. 

2. Quantify how CPOM alters heterotrophic microbial biomass.

    * H1: CPOM will increase water column bacterial abundance.

    * H2: CPOM will increase sediment bacterial biomass.
 
    * H3: CPOM will increase sediment fungal biomass.

3. Quantify how CPOM alters the response of sediment metabolism to nutrient enrichment.

    * H1: CPOM will increase SOD when the sediments are enriched with N and P.


### Experimental Design

|         | Ambient Nutrient | N + P Addition |
| :------ | :--------------: | :------------: |
| No CPOM |                5 |              5 |
| CPOM    |                5 |              5 |


* pond sediments - CPOM = sediments passed through a 250um mesh to remove all CPOM and macroinvertebrates.  Also an equivilent amount of sediment to equal the OM added from the CPOM will be added.

* pond sediments + CPOM 0.5 mg CPOM/jar = 0.16 g/m^2

* N + P addition = 2X ambient N & P


#### Response 

* N & P flux

* SOD
 
* absorbance

* bacterial biomass

* fungal biomass (Ergosterol)


#### Sample Calculations

* CPOM levels = 2

* Nutrients levels = 2 

* Replicates/level = 5

* Weeks = 6

* Nutrient/Abs/Bacteria Samples = [Samples/Week1 = 5 + ((Samples/Weeks 2:6 = 1) * 5 Weeks) = 5] = 10

* Ergosterol/AFDM Samples = 1

* Jars needed = 2 CPOM * 2 Nutrients * 5 Replicates = 20

* Total Nutrient/Abs/Bacteria Samples = 20 Jars * 10 Samples = 200 

* Total Ergosterol Samples = 20 Jars * 1 Sample = 20


#### Methods Description

##### Set Up

* Sediment samples will be collected from a local man-made pond.  The sediments will be passed through a 250&mu; mesh to remove CPOM and macroinvertebrates.

* Approximately 4 cm sediments will then be placed into 300 ml septum topped glass jars and the remaining volume will be filled with pond water collected at the same time as the sediments.

* CPOM treatments will be created by adding 0.5 mg dry mass of tulip poplar leaf disks to the surface of the sediments from tulip poplar leaved collected immediately after senescence, air dried, and then conditioned for 24 hours in pond water.

* Elevated nutrient treatments will be created by adding NO3 and PO4 at 2X the concentration measured in the overlying water at the initiation of the experiment.

##### Sampling

* The jars will be incubated in darkness at room temperature for a total of 6 weeks.


* For the first week each jar will be sampled every 24 hours:

     * 25 ml of water will be removed and filtered through GFF and frozen to measure the nutrient concentration

     * 1 ml of water will be removed and filtered through a GFF and the absorbance will be measured on a nanopore spec.

     * 5 ml of water will be removed and filtered onto a black membrane filter and stained with DAPI for bacterial counts with epiflorescence.

     * SOD will be measured by refilling the jars with pond water and sealing them without air.
 
        * 15 ml samples will be taken after 1, 3, and 6h of dark incubation without introducing air into the jars.
 
        * the oxygen content of the sample will be determined with Winkler Titration.

* For the remaining 5 weeks, each jar will be sampled once a week.

* At the conclusion of the experiment, the fungal biomass on the CPOM will be determined using ergosterol extraction.

> Ergosterol was extracted by following a method slightly modified from that of
Newell et al. (17). Leaf disks were refluxed for 30 min in alcoholic KOH (25 ml
of methanol plus 5 ml of 4% KOH in 95% methanol) at 80dC for 30 min. Leaf
disks were removed, and the extract was transferred to tubes. Water (10 ml) and
pentane (10 ml) were added, and the tubes were inverted for 3 min on a mixer
(Rotamix; 20 rpm). The pentane fraction plus two successive 5-ml aliquots of
pentane mixed in the same manner were then evaporated to dryness under a
stream of N2 at 30dC, and the residue was dissolved in 1.0 ml of methanol. The
solution was filtered (0.45-um pore size; Acrodisc) and injected into a high-
pressure liquid chromatograph (HPLC; Shimadzu) with an RP-10 column. (Suberkropp and Weyers 1996)

##### Timeline

* Early June 2014 - collect sediments and establish treatments

* June/ early July 2014 - sample experiment collect SOD data, collect absorbance data

* Fall 2014 - send off nutrients and ergosterol samples for measurement count bacteria samples

* Winter 2014/2015 - analyze data, begin manuscript preparation

* Spring 2015 - complete manuscript and present results at SFS

##### Expected Results

The results should allow us to quantify how leaf litter and nutrients interact to affect nutrient retention in the sediments of man-made ponds.  This will allow us to make predictions about how man-made ponds will alter the flow of nutrients in the watershed.
