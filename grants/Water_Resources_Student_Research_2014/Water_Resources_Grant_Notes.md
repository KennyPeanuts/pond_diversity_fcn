## Notes on Design and Experiments

### Research Questions and Justification

#### Goal

Understand the way in which man-made ponds contribute to the processing of watershed organic matter and nutrients.

#### Research Questions

1. How does the input of terrestrial detritus affect the nutrient retention or release from the sediments of man-made ponds?

2. How does the input of terrestrial detritus alter the sensitivity of pond metabolism to nutrient enrichment?


#### Objectives and Hypotheses

1. Quantify the effect of CPOM on the flux of nutrients across the sediment water interface.

    * H1: CPOM will result in an increase in N and P flux into the sediments.

    * H2: CPOM will result in an increase in DOC flux out of the sediments.

    * H3: CPOM will result in an increase in SOD. 

2. Quantify how CPOM alters heterotrophic microbial biomass.

    * H1: CPOM will increase water column bacterial abundance.

    * H2: CPOM will increase sediment bacterial biomass.
 
    * H3: CPOM will increase sediment fungal biomass.

3. Quantify how CPOM alters the response of sediment metabolism to nutrient enrichment.

    * H1: CPOM will increase SOD when the sediments are enriched with N and P.


### Experimental Design

##### Treatments

|         | Ambient Nutrient | N + P Addition |
|---------+------------------+----------------|
| No CPOM |                5 | 5              |
| CPOM    |                5 | 5              |



* pond sediments - CPOM = sediments passed through a 250um mesh to remove all CPOM and macroinvertebrates

* pond sediments + CPOM 0.5 mg CPOM/jar = 0.16 g/m^2

* N + P addition = 2X ambient N & P


##### Response 

* N & P flux

* SOD
 
* absorbance


### Response Variables

* bacterial biomass

* fungal biomass

* absorbance

* N & P flux

* SOD

* chlorophyll

* C:N:P


1. How does CPOM alter the flux of nutrients in the sediments?

    * The C:N and C:P of CPOM declines when it is incubated with inorganic nutrients (Tant et al 2013)

    * Thus the CPOM may be a sink for inorganic nutrients

2. How does CPOM alter the way that sediments respond to nutrient enrichment?

    * In streams, the respiration on the CPOM increased between 122 to 303% when enriched with N+P but the FPOM only increased 52%

    * Would this make sediment metabolism containing CPOM more sensitive to nutrient enrichment, relative to sediments that are mainly FPOM?
