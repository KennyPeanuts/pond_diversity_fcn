### Evaluation

The following criteria will be considered:

* How important is the proposed activity to advancing knowledge and understanding 
within its own field or across different fields?

* To what extent does the proposed activity suggest and explore creative and original 
concepts and innovative, promising approaches to solving water-related problems?

* How clear are the objectives of the proposed work?

* How well-qualified is the proposer (and Co-PIs) to conduct the project?

* How well-conceived and organized is the proposed activity? Is there sufficient access to 
resources?

* Does the proposed activity address water resources problems of major importance to 
Virginia or the region?

## Notes on Design and Experiments

### Research Questions and Justification

#### Does the CPOM of lake sediments alter the sequestration and flux inorganic nutrients in man-made ponds?

* How does CPOM alter the flux of nutrients in the sediments?

    * The C:N and C:P of CPOM declines when it is incubated with inorganic nutrients (Tant et al 2013)

    * We have shown that leaf mass loss is slow in man-made ponds

    * Thus the CPOM may be a sink for inorganic nutrients

* How does CPOM alter the way that sediments respond to nutrient enrichment?

    * In streams, the respiration on the CPOM increased between 122 to 303% when enriched with N+P but the FPOM only increased 52%

    * Would this make sediments containing CPOM more sensitive to nutrient enrichment, relative to sediments that are mainly FPOM?

### Response Variables

* bacterial biomass

* fungal biomass

* absorbance

* N & P flux

* SOD

* chlorophyll

* C:N:P
