Hello Lab,  welcome back. I hope that you all had a great break.  I am beginning the planning process for this semester's lab operations.  Based on the things that worked well (and not so well) last semester, I am implementing a few changes to the way the lab will be run.  One change is that we will have 2 lab meetings a week.  One of the meetings will be a maximum of 30 minutes and be devoted to lab logistics and operations (i.e. making and discussing lab plans).  The second meeting will be one hour and will be a journal club.  During the Journal Club, the members of the lab will rotate presenting papers for discussion by the group.  I will provide more details on how this will work but it should allow us to develop our understanding of background literature more effectively.  

Please complete this doodle poll (http://doodle.com/aqepx3sdbgancnrd) to let me know when you are available for these meetings. I made the poll for the first week of classes but please not your availability for the whole semester.

I also want to meet individually with each of you to review your work from last semester.  I have written an evaluation for each of the returning members of the lab that highlights where you exceeded or met expectations and where I would like to see some improvement (overall, I was really happy with your work so this will be mostly positive).  Please let me know when you are free to meet.  If you are going to be in town this week (Jan 6 - 10), I will be on campus all week.  During this meeting, I can also sign the paperwork to sign you up for next semester so bring that along.

Finally, please let me know if you will be around this (Jan 6 - 10) week to pull the leaf bags.  We should have bags coming out this week.

I am looking forward to a BIG SCIENCE this semester!

Thanks,
KF
