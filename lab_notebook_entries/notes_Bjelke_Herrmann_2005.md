# Bjelke, U. and J. Herrmann. 2005. Processing of two detritus types by lake-dwelling shredders: species-specific impacts and effects of species richness. Journal of Animal Ecology 74:92-98.

The paper evaluates the magnitude of interguild functional differences in a community of 10 coexisting lake shredders in Swedish lakes. 

* The authors evaluate the effect of shredders on alder and oak leaf breakdown in 3 L mesocosms.
* All of the shredders were caddisflies except for 1 species of isopod.  
* 7 of the shredders including the isopod are winter species and were tested in the winter at 4 ^o^C.
* The remaining 3 species were all caddisflies and are summer species that were tested in the summer at 15 ^o^C.
* The also included mixed species treatments with up to 4 species combinations.

Within the shredder guild there were significant differences in the effect of the shredder species on the breakdown of the leaves. Notably the isopod only reduced leaf mass by 2-3% while the caddisflies reduced leaf mass by 10-40%. 

Among the caddisflies the season did not make that big of a difference in the functional response with the very similar losses of leaf mass at 4 and 15 ^o^C.

The leaf source was not that important.  Only 2 species showed significantly greater breakdown of the alder leaves despite evidence of higher quality.

Some of the differences observed among species was due to size differences between the species.  When the rates of leaf mass loss were normalized to animal biomass, the differences became less dramatic.  

    | Season | Loss (g (ind d)^-1^) | Loss (g (g d)^-1^) |
    | ------ | -------------------- | ------------------ |
    | Winter | 0.0005 - 0.014       | 0.05 - 0.5         |
    | Summer | 0.0025 - 0.009       | 0.35 - 1.3         |

There was no effect of diversity on leaf breakdown.  All of the mixed species treatments were additive.
