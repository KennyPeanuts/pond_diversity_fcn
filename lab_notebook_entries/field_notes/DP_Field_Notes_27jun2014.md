# Daulton Pond Field Sampling

## Date

27 June 2014

## Authors/Data Collection

KF, KP

## Location

Daulton Pond

## Purpose

* YSI Profile

* Collect water for Chl a, spec scans, and pH

## Field observations

* The deepest location we could find was 3.4 m

* Secchi Depth = `1.4 m`

* We collected 1 L of water from the surface (0.5m) just by submerging the bottle and 1 L of water from 3 m using the van dorn

### YSI Profile

These data are collected with the new YSI 600 sonde with the optical DO probe

In lab data and data collection:

Nutrient samples- filtered through GFF
	Depth (m)	Vol filtered (ml)
	 0.5		 30
	 3		 30

Absorbance samples- filtered through same GFF as nutrient samples
	Depth (m)	Vol filtered (ml)
	 0.5		 10
	 3		 10
Chlorophyll samples- the chlorophyll filters were the same filters used for the nurtients and absorbance, in addition to the added water necessary to clog the filters.
	Depth (m)	Vol filtered (ml)	Vol acetone (ml)
