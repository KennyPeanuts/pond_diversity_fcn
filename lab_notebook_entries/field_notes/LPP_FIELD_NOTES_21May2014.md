## Location

Lancer Park Pond

## Purpose

To pull out five random bags containing leaves for processing and further testing of leaf decomposition rates.

## Field observations

-All 5 bags were placed in the fridge at 6:25 p.m. on May 21.  
-Due to the increased amount of time processing took because of the multiple fragments the leaves had separated into, bags #9, 44, and 54 were processed on May 22 after being taken out of the fridge at 9:08 a.m. 
	-Bag #'s 2 and 21 were placed in the fridge at 8:30 p.m., in the partially sealed zip lock bags that were used to collect the samples from the site. 
	-The bags were taken out at 11:55 a.m. on May 23 to be processed.   
-In addition, many of the leaves were extremely fragmented, making it difficult to figure out which leaves were originally in the bags and which were from outside source(s).
