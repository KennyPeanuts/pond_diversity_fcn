## Location

Campus Pond

## Purpose

To pull out five random bags containing leaves for processing and further testing of leaf decomposition rates.

## Field observations

-The pond was extremely muddy, which resulted in large amounts of mud in the samples.  
-Due to the increased amount of time processing took with all of the extra mud, bags #21 and #39 were processed on May 19. 
	-Bag #'s 6, 13, and 64 were placed in the fridge at 8:30 p.m., in the partially sealed zip lock bags that were used to collect the samples from the site. 
	-The bags were taken out between 8a.m. and 9a.m. on May 20th to be processed.   
-In addition, many of the leaves were extremely fragmented, making it difficult to figure out which leaves were originally in the bags and which were from outside source(s).
