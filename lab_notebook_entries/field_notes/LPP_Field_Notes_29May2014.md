# Lancer Park Pond CPOM Density Measurement and Sediment Collection for CPOM Flux Exp.

## Date: 29 May 2014

## Location
 
Lancer Park Pond

## Purpose

1) We collected sediment to fill the BOD bottles for the CPOM Flux Exp.

2) We collected CPOM to calculate the density of CPOM in the sediments.

3) We collected water to provide the initial overlying water for the CPOM Flux Exp. BOD bottles.

### Secchi Depth 

`0.5 m `

### Water Collection

The sample bottles were rinsed with surface water and then filled at approximately 0.5 m depth with the Van Dorn.

### CPOM and Sediment Collection

Sediment samples were collected with the Ekman at 2 locations:

* Samples A and B were collected in 1 m of water closer to the dam and approx 10 m from shore.

* Samples C and D were collected in 0.4 m of water closer to the inlet and approx 15 m from shore but nearer to overlying tree limbs.

After collection the samples were passed through a 250 um mesh and the sediment that passed through was collected into a 20 L bucket. The sediments from A and D were combined into a single bucket, as were the sediments from C and D.

The CPOM retained by the 250 um mesh was placed in a 1 L bottle and returned to the lab w/o preservation.  

At the lab the CPOM was passed thorugh 1 mm mesh and all retained plant material was dried at 50 dC in a pre-weighed paper bag.

The sediments were allowed to settle overnight in the buckets.
