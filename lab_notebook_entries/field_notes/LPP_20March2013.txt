On March 20, 2013 samples were collected from Lancer Park pond by using the Ekman; samples were collected in the center of the pond and then near the forested area within the S margin of the pond. The center pond samples were collected at 1.0m, which was considered the open sample. At this point in the water, the secchi depth was 0.25m. Next, the samples were taken at 1.1m, and approximately 2m from shore. Three samples were taken at each location of the pond, and once samples were collected OM was the collected in a pre-weighed seint vial. Then during the wash process CPOM was removed, and was stored in 1L bottles; all samples were washed through 250µm. Returning back to lab, CPOM was separated into FPOM and CPOM samples by the filtration 1mm mesh sieve. The particles that were collected within the sieve were considered CPOM and then organic matter that was collected in the bottom bucket was considered FPOM. Note: all samples from the field were stored and preserved in 70% EtOH.
