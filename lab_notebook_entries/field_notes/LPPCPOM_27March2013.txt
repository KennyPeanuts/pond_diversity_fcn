This past week we were working on picking through the Lancer Park Pond samples. On Wednesday, March 27, instead of going into the field to collect more samples, we stayed in the lab. We took the CPOM from Lancer Park Pond and washed it through the 1mm mesh sieve and then placed in a basin. The CPOM was then looked through to see if organisms were left in the samples. A few chironomids were found in each of the samples but the big find was one dragonfly larvae. After the organisms were picked from the CPOM samples, they were placed in the collection bottles to be counted at a later date. The CPOM was then placed in a pre-weight brown paper bag and placed in the drying oven at 50 degrees Celsius. Next week we will weigh the bags and record the mass. We are still working on thinking of a way to ash the Lancer Park Pond CPOM due to the sticks found in the samples.
Our goal for this coming week is to finish picking the samples, keep finding articles for our research poster, to ash the WL CPOM samples, and to learn how to count the organisms.
