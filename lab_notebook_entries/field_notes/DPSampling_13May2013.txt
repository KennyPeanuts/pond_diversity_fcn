Samples were collected from a residential pond on May 13, 2013. Two samples per sampling location were taken and done at varying depths; all littoral samples taken were approximately 10m away from the shore. Open A was taken near the dam at 3.2m, open B was in the middle near the forested side at 3.1m, open C was opposite of dam at 1.9m. Note: open C had a hard gritty bottom. Littoral A was taken on the non-forested side near the dam at 1.5m, littoral B was on forested side near the dam at 0.9m, and littoral C was opposite side of dam near the typha and inlet at 1.5m. Note: all litoral samples were taken approximately 10m from shore.
