Campus Pond, Longwood Campus

## Purpose

These notes record field observations of the campus pond water level.

## Field observations

Since the previous observation on 4 Jan 2014, CP has remained full of water and the bags have remained submerged.  The pond froze over and remained frozen for approximately 2 days during the week of 6 Jan 2013 due to very cold conditions.  The water level dropped under the ice and the ice sheet partially broke up mnear the shore but the bags stayed under the water and the ice.  On 10 Jan 2013, additional rain cause flooded the pond again but the ice did not float and the new water was above the ice-sheet.  

AG sampled the pond on 12 Jan 2013 and found the bags underwater with no ice on the pond.
