Sampling for the Ethanol Preservation Experiment was done on 11 June 2013 at Wilck’s Lake. Twenty Ekman samples were taken from the open locations and washed through 250?m mesh, and 10 samples were preserved in EtOH in field.
Sample A was taken at 1.3 m about 10 m from forested shore. Note: sample was very sandy, and sample A treatment was split between sample A and B bottles. Sample C was at 2.0 m about 50 m from shore; the sample had a muddy clay consistency. Sample D was taken at 1.5 m roughly 25 m from the shore and the sample was a muddy sand. Sample E was taken at 2 m 2/3 to the forested shore, which was contained muddy clay. Sample F was taken at 2.1 m, sample G at 2.1 m, sample H at 2 m, and sample I at 1.7 m; these four samples were a muddy clay. Sample J was taken near the library shore at 1.4 m, and was a sandy mud.
Note: samples were collect along a transect from the library to the forest shore.
Secchi depth = 0.6m
