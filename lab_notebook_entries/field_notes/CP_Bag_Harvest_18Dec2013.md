# Field Notes for Pond Leaf Decomposition Bag Harvest

## Date

18 Dec 2013

## Location

Campus Pond (CP)

## Purpose

Harvest leaf bags 1, 4, 37, 52, and 66 using the standard harvest procedure.

The bag numbers were selected with a random number table.

## Field observations

I actually collected bag 2 instead of bag 1 because the number was difficult to read in the field and I did not see a bag ahead (i.e., to the left) of the one I collected.

Bag 52 was clearly stuck in the mud when I pulled it up.

Other than 52 the bags came up easily.
