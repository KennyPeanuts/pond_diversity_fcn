# Lancer Park Pond Field Sampling

## Date

23 June 2014

## Authors/Data Collection

KF, KP

## Location

Lancer Park Pond

## Purpose

* YSI Profile

* Collect water for Chl a, spec scans, and pH

## Field observations

* The pond level was down. The deepest location we could find was 1.1 m

* Secchi Depth = `0.7 m`

* We collected 1 L of water from the surface just by submerging the bottle and 1 L of water from 1 m

### YSI Profile

These data are collected with the new YSI 600 sonde with the optical DO probe

### pH

pH was measured with the lab meter on 26 June 2014 after the samples were stored in the refridgerator.

* Surface Sample = `7.42`

* Deep Sample = `7.53`
