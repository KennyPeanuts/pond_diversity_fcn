# Lancer Park Sampling
## 20 March 2013

### Goal/ Sampling Design

The goal of the sampling was to collect data to assess the relationship between CPOM and macroinvertebrate functional diversity.

The sampling design was to collect 3 replicate Ekman samples from a _littoral_ section of the lake and an _open_ section.  

### Sampling Location & Site Description

The _open_ samples were collected from the approximate middle of the pond and the littoral samples were collected from along the S, forested bank within about 20 m of the dam.  The deepest depth recorded in the pond was just along the dam margin in the SW corer of the lake.  Overall the pond is about 1 m deep but get gradually deeper as you move toward the SW.  The S bank drops off very steeply and the _littoral_ sample was collected in 1.1 m of water only about 2 m from shore.  

The water was turbid and clay colored. The inlet enters on the E side of the pond through a marshy forested area.

#### Sample Data

The samples were clay mud with lots of CPOM.  There was a lot more CPOM in the littoral samples.  Many of the leaves from the sample were intact but clearly microbially conditioned.  The sediment that was retained in the 250&mu;m mesh appeared to be mainly FBOM + CPOM.  The _open_ samples also had lots of benthic macroalgae - that I presume to be a form of nostoc.

Oligochaetes and chironomus (some very large) were seen during sample washing.

    Site          Dist. from shore      Depth
    -------------------------------------------
    open          approx middle          1.0 m
    littoral      approx 2 m from shore  1.1 m


    Secchi depth = 0.25 m 



### Sample Processing

Sediment LOI samples were collected by dipping a pre-weighed scintillation vial (20 ml) into the homogenized sediment before the samples were washed.  The sediment OM was then dried at 50^o^ C.

The samples were washed through 250&mu;m net in the field.  For the _open_ samples, large pieces of CPOM were removed from the net during washing and placed in a 1 L bottle the remaining washed material was collected in a 250 ml bottle.  The amount of CPOM in the _littoral_ samples was so great that the whole washed sample was placed into a 1 L bottles.  Due to the size of the samples, we ran out of 70% ethanol in the field and the littoral B and C replicates were not preserved until we got back to the lab.  

To separate the coarse CPOM from the fine OM we washed all of the samples through a 1 mm mesh sieve.  All OM retained by the sieve was collected as CPOM and all OM that passed through was collected as fine OM.  All of these samples were preserved in 70% 

The macroinvertebrates were collected from the coarse samples when they were washed through the sieve and then again by spreading the OM out in a dish basin and picking

Once the macroinvertebrates were picked, the CPOM was placed into a pre-weighed paper lunch bag and dried at 50^o^ C.

### Measuring CPOM AFDM (proposed)

There is too much CPOM in the littoral samples to ash the whole sample, so the plan is to homogenize the sample with a mortar and pestel and then ash a subsample. The only concern with this is that some of the largest pieces cannot be homogenized (e.g., sticks and nuts) this will potentially bias the AFDM measure.
