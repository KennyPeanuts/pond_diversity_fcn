## Location

Daulton Pond

## Purpose

To pull out five random bags containing leaves for processing and further testing of leaf decomposition rates.

## Field observations

-Due to the increased amount of time processing took because of the high level of leaf fragmentation, bags #17, 52, and 56 were processed on May 21. 
	-Bag #'s 68 and 70 were placed in the fridge at 6:25 p.m., in the partially sealed zip lock bags that were used to collect the samples from the site. 
	-The bags were taken out at 9:08 a.m. on May 22 to be processed.   
-Many of the leaves were extremely fragmented, making it difficult to figure out which leaves were originally in the bags and which were from outside source(s).
