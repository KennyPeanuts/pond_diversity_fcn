# Notes on OM in small ponds

Typically when CPOM is considered in lentic systems the focus in on shredder activity in leaf packs.  However we have noticed that CPOM in LPP and WL is much more diffuse and embedded w/in the sediments.  We have also failed to notice any shredder taxa in the Ekman samples. 

* Does this result from the fact that these are impoundments in a largely lake-less region - are there lentic shredders in the regional species pool?

* What is the implication of a lack of shredder taxa on OM breakdown in a system with high CPOM inputs?
