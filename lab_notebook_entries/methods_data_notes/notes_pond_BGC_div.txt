# Notes on pond BGC and diversity study

## Initial observation from Lancer Park Pond sampling; 6 Feb 2013
 
The sediments from the small pond adjacent to Lancer Park, Farmville Va (LPP) were largely clay but contained substantial amounts of coarse leaf litter (CPOM).  I saw some old algal mats floating on the surface of the pond near the inlet but these may have been washed in from flooded areas of the upstream flood plain.  The water was turbid with a secchi depth of only 0.3 m. The maximum depth we found was 1.2 m  but most of the pond seemed to be between 0.5 and 1 m in depth.  Despite the turbidity there appeared to be nostoc balls associated with the sediments of some of the samples, and in one of the samples the ethanol used to preserve the sediments turned green, indicating abundant benthic chlorophyll.  

Initial picking of the samples found very abundant _ostracods_ (but these were not picked), _oligochaete fragments_, _chaoborus_, _chironiminae_ and _tanypodinae_.

## Notes on research plan

The abundant leaf litter in the sediments has me thinking about the role of leaf litter in the benthic food web of ponds.  It is notable that so far we have not found anything that would be classified as a shredder in the Lancer Park Pond.  This could mean that leaf litter is breaking down slowly.  One possibility is that the pond has a high sedimentation rate so that leaves are buried rapidly - preventing colonisation by shredders. 

An initial literature search found limited studies on the role of leaf litter in pond food webs with the exception of seasonal forest pools.  Wilkes Lake (WL) is completely forested on virtually all sides and likely gets abundant leaf litter inputs.  The sedimentation rate of WL is likely less than that of LPP so there may be more shredder activity.

### Possible research directions

1. Comparison of the functional diversity of LPP and WL.
2. Comparison of the CPOM (and just sediment OM) pool of WL and LPP
3. Comparison of the CPOM pool within WL - specifically looking at changes in the pool as you move away from the forested margins.
4. Evaluation of the functional diversity wrt the abundance of CPOM, OM, benthic chl.

#### Notes on methods for research directions  

Directions 1 and 2 could be combined into a single project by quantifying _functional diversity_, _leaf mass_, and _sediment LOI_ from Ekman samples take from the lakes.  The challenge would be getting a representative sample from WL due to its greater size and heterogeneity.

Directions 3 and 4 could be combined into a single project by quantifying _functional diversity_, _leaf mass_, _sediment LOI_, (and perhaps benthic chl) from Ekman samples taken along transects from the margins to the center of the lake.  One problem with this approach is the confounding effect of depth there appears to be a region on the W end of the lake that is relatively uniformly shallow.  So perhaps the best approach would be a depth X distance from shore sampling protocol.  

#### Hypotheses

1. Macroinvertebrate functional diversity will be greater in sediments with greater resource diversity (e.g., FBOM, CPOM, phytobenthos).

2. CPOM pools will be greater near forested shorelines.

3. WL will have a more sediment OM, greater spatial resource heterogeneity and greater functional diversity than LPP.
