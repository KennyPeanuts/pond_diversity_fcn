# Wilkes Lake CPOM Processing
## Samples collected on 20 Febuary 2013

Originally the CPOM was picked from the washed samples by hand and we were estimating which fragments were greater than 1 mm.  This was inefficient and inaccurate. 

To correct and standardize this process we rinsed the picked fraction of the samples though a 1 mm sieve after all of the macroinvertebrates were removed and placed any retained OM into the CPOM sample weigh boat to be dried at 50^o^ C.

Future samples will be washed through the 1 mm sieve to separate them into a fine and coarse fraction before they are picked.
