# Research Notes on the Summer Research Plan for 2013

## Previous Ideas

Previously I identified [5 questions][1] that have emerged from the initial sampling and data analysis.  These question all focus on the breakdown of CPOM and the lack of shredders in the two ponds that we have sampled.  It seems striking that the sediment faunal diversity is so low - essentially dominated by tanypodinae and oligochaets, with minor contributions from ceratopogonidae, chaoborus, and chironominae.  Furthermore, the samples contain between 0.2 and 29 g of CPOM per Ekman and yet we have not seen any shredding species.  

The CPOM in the samples is leaf litter and the amount of CPOM appears to be related to the distance the sample was from a forested shoreline.  The lowest CPOM masses were found in the samples collected from the middle of WL and the greatest CPOM masses were in samples collected about a meter from the shore of LPP.  Interestingly, both LPP and WL have such odd bathymetry that all of these sample were collected at virtually the same dept.

Given the prevalence of CPOM in the samples and the very preliminary results that the amount of CPOM may affect the benthic community composition, it seems logical to focus on CPOM.  This however presents a problem for the summer research, since leaf litter experiments need to be conducted in the fall.

I am thinking this summer's plan should therefore focus on characterizing the CPOM in the pond and trying to assess the factors controlling CPOM abundance and the diversity of the macroinvertebrates.

## Summer Research Plan Notes 

### Questions

1. What is the relationship between sediment CPOM mass, pond size, and land use?
2. What is the relationship between sediment biodiversity, pond size, and CPOM mass?

### Factors that could affect CPOM pool

1. Input of leaves
    1. shoreline vegetation
    2. pond size
    3. sample location

2. Leaf decomposition
    1. leaf burial 
    2. macroinvertebrate community
    3. microbial metabolism
    4. temperature
    5. oxygen availability

### Factors that could affect benthic macroinvertebrates 

1. Habitat availability (CPOM)
2. Physical or sediment conditions (e.g., low O2, sand)
3. Phenology/Season (I am not sure when these taxa emerge)

### Variables to collect

1. CPOM mass
2. Sediment LOI
3. Secci depth
4. Water-column chla
5. benthic invertebrate abundance and composition
6. pond size
7. thermocline depth
8. hypolimnetic oxygen 
9. other benthic animal abundance (snails, crayfish, tadpoles)
