1. detrital accrual is density independent and affected by pool size
2. detrital ontogeny (i.e., transformations in quality) is the result of the activity of the species in the system other than the ones that made the detritus
3. detritus does not require energy for maintenance of the pool, so it can serve as a storage resource and habitat.

Detrital based systems are viable at lower levels of detrital input due to the lack of maintenance costs and interspecific "producer" competition (i.e., density dependent resource growth).

Detritus is more stable and resilient than prim prod over a large range of productivity measures --> _In this analysis, I am assuming that detrital productivity is simply the production of detritus and therefore would be tied very closely to prim. prod. either within the system or somewhere else._
