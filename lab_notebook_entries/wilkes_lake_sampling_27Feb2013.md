# Wilkes Lake Sampling
## 27 Febuary 2013

### Goal/ Sampling Design

The goal of the sampling was to continue collecting data to assess the relationship between CPOM and macroinvertebrate functional diversity.

The sampling design was to collect 3 replicate Ekman samples from a _littoral_ section of the lake, an _open shallow_ section, and a _open deep_ section.  The _littoral_ and _open shallow_ sections were intended to be similar in depth and therefore similar physical environments but represent a gradient of CPOM inputs.  The _deep_ sample was intended to capture the effect of focussing on CPOM distribution.

The _littoral_ and _open shallow_ samples were collected on 2013-Feb-20

### Sampling Location & Site Description

We put the boat in on the N shore of the lake at the beach adjacent to the parking lot.  The bottom drops off quickly at this site to approximately 2 m and remains at 2 m across the entire lake.  Heading E in the lake the bottom very gradually slopes up toward the outflow on the E end of the lake but overall the lake was astonishingly uniform in depth (between 1.5 and 2 m)

#### Sample Data

Additional depth information showed that there really is no deep spot in the lake.  So the _deep_ samples were basically more _open_ samples taken more toward the E end of the lake (near the retaining walls on the S shore).  Replicates A and B were taken at approximately the same spot and replicate C was collected on a separate boat trip.  

Interestingly, samples A and C looked very similar and had a high clay content with abundant CPOM in the form of black leaf fragments. Sample B, despite being taken near sample A had a much higher sand content and a lower volume of mud, suggesting a harder bottom.

Oligochaetes and chironomus were seen during sample washing.

    Site          Dist. from shore    Depth
    ----------------------------------------
    open (A & B)  approx middle       1.9 m
    open (C)      approx middle       1.9 m


    Secchi depth = 0.6 m 



### Sample Processing

We did not collect the LOI samples.

All of the samples were washed through 250 &mu;m nets and preserved in 70% EtOH in the field.
