# Research Notes on the Summer Research Plan for 2013

The original project goal was to relate functional diversity to the mineralization of OM in the sediments in a similar way to the experiments in the Nature Park Quarry pond.  In those experiments there was a relationship between the presence/absence of tanypodinae and chironominae and SOD as well as water column chlorophyll and bacterial abundance.  There was also a relationship between the tanypode/chironominae and the spectral absorbance of the lake water.

Initial sampling of WL and LPP indicate some important differences between these ponds and the QP.  For one, there is a lot more CPOM in these ponds than in QP.  This observation and the fact that this is likely to be more typical of small ponds (than the QP) suggest that questions surrounding the breakdown of the CPOM may be important.  We have also failed to collect any shredders from LPP or WL in any of the Ekman samples.  It is possible that crayfish or other organisms (tadpoles) may be functioning as shredders.  Tadpoles have been observed in LPP but we have not seen any crayfish.  Very preliminary data from WL also shows very few chironominae and a benthic fauna dominated by oligochaetes and tanypodinae.

This leads to a few initial questions:

## Initial Questions

1. What limits presence of traditionally identified shredders in these systems?
2. Are the observed species filling the shredder function or is it vacant?
3. How does the observed diversity affect the breakdown of CPOM in these systems?
4. How does the presence of CPOM alter sediment metabolism (SOD)?
5. What is the relationship between CPOM/ sediment OM and benthic macroinvertebrate diversity?

## Research Approaches to Questions

1. This question is likely going to be hard to get at and is not likely to be feasible for the lab in the ear future.  The approach that I am most attracted to at the moment is to expand the sampling to verify that there really aren't traditional shredders found in the region.  I can see 2 hypotheses regarding their absence: 
    1. They are limited biogeographically. The historic lack of lakes in the region has prevented the development of a lentic shredder fauna.  I just can't see how this would be true.  I found shredders in the mountains of NC and there were no historic lakes their either. I have also observed lots of Limnophillid caddisflies in the creek at Hampden-Sydney and in a creek at Twin Lakes SP that was just adjacent to the larger lake.  We need to sample the ponds at Twin Lake to see if they are in there. It would also be good to sample Chalgrove Lake at H-S.
    2. They are excluded by the physical conditions of the ponds.  I think the sedimentation rate and low oxygen might be important factors. It would be really useful to have oxygen concentration measurements near the benthos.

2. We can address this question with leaf litter decomposition experiments.  Litter bags with different size mesh where we exclude large, and all macroinvertebrates would test the effect of the macroinvertebrate community on the breakdown rate.  One possibility is that the macros are only using the litter for substrate and that their presence would have no effect.  Or they could be fragmenting the litter and accelerating breakdown.

These field experiments would be difficult to do this summer because the leaf litter would not be there but I do have some black walnut leaves in the lab that were collected last fall that we could use for lab experiments perhaps in combination with experiments to address question 3. I will likely wait until the fall.

3. I am not sure to do with this question since there is not a lot of diversity at the taxonomic resolution that we are currently using.  I need to evaluate this more quantitatively but the community seems to be dominated by tanypodinae and not much else.  There are also oligochaetes but due to inconsistencies in the picking we cannot quantify these - nonetheless, that still only leaves 2 functional groups. 

One possibility is to look at the effect of non-shredders (i.e., Tanypods) on the breakdown of CPOM.  We could do this with leaf-disks from the Black Walnut leaves and evaluate the effect of the tanypods on the mass remaining and the distribution of the leaves within the sediments.

4. This question has a lot of promise for the summer.  We can use existing levels of CPOM in the sediments or manipulations of the sediment CPOM with the saved Black Willow leaves.

5. This question could be tied into question 1 and is basically the question we have been addressing this Spring.  Continued sampling of ponds in the area and quantifying the CPOM and benthic diversity.
