Eutrophic urban pond in OK

Collected 30 benthic taxa from 2871 individuals over a year of monthly sampling

Community was overall 48% Procladius, 13.4% Chironomus sp, and 10.3% Cladopelma sp

Procladius was always dominant except in Oct. when the emerge and then Chironominae (Chironomus and Cladopelma) dominated

Chironominae comprised 50% of community in July and 80% in Oct.

Orthocladinae was only found in April and was 0.4% of community

Shannon diversity was greatest in Oct, which the authors attribute to the input of leaf litter

The littoral samples had higher diversity than the open-water samples, which the authors atribute to the greater amount of CPOM in the littoral zone and thus the greater amount of habitat complexity

Littoral samples were more similar to each other than to open samples
