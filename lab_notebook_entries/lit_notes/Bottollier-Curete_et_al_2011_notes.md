# Degradation of native and exotic riparian plant leaf litter in a floodplain pond. 

## Freshwater Biology 56:1798-1810 doi:10.0000/j.1365-2427.2011.02620.x

## Questions

1) Do native and exotic litter degrade at different rates in ponds?
2) Do native and exotic litter affect the macroinvert community structure of the leaf-pack communities

## Methods
### Site 

Groundwater fed floodplain pond in France - the physical and chemical conditions in the pond differed along its N-S axis (presumably due to the groundwater inputs)

### Leaf Packs

5 g leaf packs in 10 mm mesh weighted bags

Bags placed in 5 bag blocks along the pond margin

## Results

Dissolved O_2 was 41 and 15% saturated in the different regions of the pond but this difference did not affect breakdown rate.

Less than 20% of total mass remained after 1 year for all species

There was no difference in breakdown between the native and exotic species

Decay constants (k) ranged  0.0060 - 0.0575 across species.

Leaf nutritional quality did not differ between native and exotic species but did differ among species

Only C/N was significantly related to k - it is an exponential model where k = 0.4 * exp(-0.6 * C:N), p < 0.01 and adjR^2 = 0.63

Litter origin (exotic or native) did not affect invert assemblage 

The community was dominated by filterers (this includes Cladocera)
