# The timing of winter-growing shredder species and leaf litter turn over rate in an oligotrophic lake, SE Sweden.

## Hydropbiologia 556:99-108

## Hypothesis

Shredder abundance in littoral zones would be positively related to the abundance of litter

## Methods
### Study Site

Lake Valen, Sweden - oligo/mesotrophic, sa = 2.7 km^2 

### Litter bags

double plastic mesh with 12 mm upper surface and a 6 mm lower surface

contained 2 g dry mass of oak or birch leaves, rush stems added in exp 2 as non-edible substrate

deployed at 50 cm depth in the littoral zone

collected 1/month for 178 days (exp 1) or 248 days (exp 2)

## Results

The abundance of the Tricopteran shredders was correlated with the period of greatest leaf mass lost in the litter bags.

The abundance of the other macroinvertebrate species was not correlated with the period of greatest mass loss.

## Comments

This paper has a fairly myopic data analysis.  The authors do not calculate k for either of the leaf species and they only focus their community analysis on the previously identified shredders.  

The use of correlation between abundance and max litter mass loss to assess the importance of shredders is suggestive but weak.  It is possible (likely) that the mass loss is unrelated to the shredders and the correlation is due to covariance.
