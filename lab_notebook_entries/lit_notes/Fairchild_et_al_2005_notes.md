# The trophic state 'chain of relationships' in ponds: does size matter?

## Hydropbiologia 539:35-46

## Question:

The authors evaluate whether ponds behave similarly to shallow lakes with respect to the linkages between nutrients and primary production.  They hypothesize the smaller SA of ponds may alter the linkages and create different behaviors.

They test the effect of pond size on:

1) chl a predicted by TP

2) secchi depth predicted by chl a

3) stratification depth predicted by secchi depth

## Methods
### Study Site

* 13 man-made ponds in Chester Co. PA
* 7 residential ponds and 6 farm ponds
* SA = 0.13:1.69 ha
* Z_mean = 0.59:1.80 m

## Results

* 6 of 13 ponds had < 1% DO in the bottom water by July
* TP ranged from 20 - 179 ug/L and was made up of mainly particulate P, which incr. from 66% to 76% from March to July
* TN ranged from 683 - 3895 ug/L and DON and PN incr. from March to July.
* DIN declined to < 5% of TN in 7 ponds from March to July but did not decline in the remaining 6
* TN declined from March to July, TP incr. from March to July
* TN/TP ratios declined from March to July, suggesting P limitation in March and colimitation in July

### Test of specific predictions

1) Chl a was positively correlated with TP and the relationship strengthened from March to July

2) Chl a was negatively correlated with Secchi depth

3) Stratification depth was positively correlated with transparency

## Conclusions

The authors do not find that small man-made ponds are reasonably well described by the dynamics of shallow natural lakes of much greater size.
