## Question

How does organic matter sedimentation affect the dCO2 dynamics in lakes?

If sedimentation represents a flux of C to the sediments then the sedimentation rate should alter the dCO2 of the lake water.  The presence of other trophic levels should alter the flux based on trophic cascade theory.  However herbivores may stimulate sedimentation through the production of fecal particles or they may reduce it through the reduction in algal biomass.

## Methods

Used 900 L mesocosms with treatments:

1) Algae only
2) Algae + Herbivores (Zoop)
3) Algae + Herbivores + Predators (Chaoborus)

## Results

Chl a and sedimentation matched the predictions of  trophic cascade theory:  the A and A+H+C were greater then A+H

Log dCO2 was negatively collinear with sedimentation rate in virtually all of the mesocosms
