# Cascading effects of predatory fish on the detritus-based food web of a lake littoral zone (Lake Vico, Central Italy)

## Oecologia 133(3):402-411

## Question

Used a cage/leaf pack experiment to assess the effect of fish predators on the macroinvertebrate community structure and breakdown rate of Phrag. litter in a lake littoral zone.

## Study Site

* Lake Vico in Italy
* SA = 12.1 km^2
* Z_max = 48.5 m

## Methods

Leaf packs of Phrag litter (3.0 g) were deployed in cages of 3 treatments:

1. Control = the cage admitted all predators
2. Small mesh = the cage covered in 3 mm mesh excluding all vertebrate predators
3. Large mesh = the cage covered in 10 mm mesh excluding only large vertebrate predators

Leaf packs were collected at 3, 10, 20, 30, and 45 d and bugs were washed live from the leaves

Fungal biomass was determined using a separate leaf pack.

## Results

Detritivores comprised 82% of the total invertebrate biomass

The community consisted of:

* Amphipods = 64% of total biomass
* Isopods = 54% of total biomass
* Scraping snails = 13% of total biomass
* Chironominae and Oligochaetes = 4% of biomass but 34% of total number 

The detritivore abundance and biomass was significantly greater in the fish exclusion treatments but there was no effect on species richness

Some of the effect was due to an increase in the abundance of some taxa while some of the effect was due to an increase in the size of individuals with no change in abundance.

There was greater abundance and biomass of chironomids in the fish exclosures

The fungal biomass was 43% greater in the open (predator incl) cages than in the exclusions, but there was no effect of treatment on the fungal community richness.

## Discussion

The lack of a treatment effect on the invertebrate predators combined with a negative treatment effect on the detritivores, a positive treatment effect of the fungal biomass, and positive treatment effect on k suggests a trophic cascade from fish to detritivores to fungus which affects leaf decomposition.
