# Pope RJ, Gordan, AM, and Kaushik NK 1999. Leaf litter colonization by invertebrates in the littoral zone of a small oligotrophic lake. Hydrobiologia 392:99-112

The authors evaluate the macroinvertebrate colonization of leaf packs and the leaf decay rate in the littoral zone of an oligotrophic lake in Ontario, Canada.  The lake is 28 ha and sub-boreal

## Methods

The authors conduct 2 leaf-pack studies where 5 g leaf packs of Maple, Beech and Maple + Beech were place in the littoral zone of the lake for approx. 1 yr.  

The first study used fall shed leaves and the second study used conditioned leaves found in the spring

## Results

There was no difference in the richness of macros collected from the different leaf species in the fall or spring leaf experiments 

    Total richness 
               Maple    Beech    M + B 
    Fall       40       38       38
    Spring     nr       48       42

Invertebrate abundance (number per g remaining leaf) was greatest at the end of the experiments and increased initially but remained fairly level through the winter (under the ice) for both the spring and the fall leaves.

Chironomids made up 35 - 95% of total abundance on the fall leaves and 72% of the abundance on the spring leaves

As a result the leaf packs were dominated by collector taxa numerically - however some large shredders were found and may have been more important by biomass

The mass loss followed normal exponential decay:
