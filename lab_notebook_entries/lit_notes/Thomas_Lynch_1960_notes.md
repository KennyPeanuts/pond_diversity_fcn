You can determine the ionic concentration of bicarbonate, carbonate, and hydroxide if you know the total alkalinity and the pH.

The accuracy of the determination is dependent on the accuracy of the measurement of total alk. and pH

### Recommended procedure

1) Titrate 25 - 100 ml of sample to pH 4.5 with standard acid and record the volume of acid needed (X_1)

2) Continue titrating to pH 4.2 and record the volume of acid needed (X_2)

3) The amount of acid needed to titrate from 4.5 to 4.2 (X_1 - X_2) is subtracted from the amount of acid needed to go to 4.5 (X_1) to get:

> the amount of acid required to neutralize the alkalinity to the true equivalence point of the bicarbonate-carbonic acid dissociation.

4) Calculate alk as:

    (1000f / ml samp) * (2X_1 - X_2)
