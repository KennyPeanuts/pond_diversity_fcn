On of their main points is that there need not be a simple correlation between these two types of traits and therefore changes to diversity may not affect ecosystem function positively.  Their model provides a means of making predictions about how diversity and function are related.

Given that functional traits often represent trade offs between different processess it is reasonable to assume that the
