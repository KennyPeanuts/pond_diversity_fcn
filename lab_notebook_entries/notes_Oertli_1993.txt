# Oertli, B. 1993. Leaf litter processing and energy flow through mcroinvertebrates in a woodland pond (Switzerland). Oecologia 96:466-477

Woodland ponds share many characteristics of other littoral systems: have same substrates (macrophytes, litter, mud) 

## Study Site

* Man-made pond, constructed in 1969
* 4400 m^2^, mean Z = 0.8 m, max Z = 2 m
* surrounded by deciduous forest
* Substrate by area 25% leaf litter, 13% sub. macrophytes, 28% emergent macrophytes
* Leaf litter accumulation patchy; max values = 180 - 1400 g m^-2^ y^-1^

The authors estimate oak leaf decay and macroinvertebrate production in leaf packs as well as in chara and Typha beds in a small forested impoundment.

Oak leaf decay constant = -0.0014, 32% of leaf mass remained after one year so leaves represented a consistent habitat throughout the year.

    Group         Density    Biomass   Production 
    ---------------------------------------------
    Chironomidae  64         60        82
    Oligochaeta   31         9         
    Limniphilidae            15        4
    
    * Note that Chironomidae excludes the tanypodinae

    Group          Density    Biomass    Production
    -----------------------------------------------
    Tanypodinae    57         7.6        60
    Ceratopogonid  14

Predator density was 6% of total but 12% of total production

**Shredders consumed only 19% of leaf mass (post leaching), 81% of the leaf mass lost due to microbial processing.** This is much smaller than is typically seen in streams.
