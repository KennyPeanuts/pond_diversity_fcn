**FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY AFFECTS ORGANIC MATTER PROCESSING IN THE SEDIMENTS OF A SHALLOW MAN-MADE POND**

The number of man-made ponds is increasing but the effect of these systems on carbon cycling remains poorly described.  Man-made ponds represent a unique aquatic habitat with unique patterns of biodiversity and biogeochemistry.  We investigated the relationship between functional diversity and organic matter processing in a shallow quarry pond near DePauw University, Indiana.  The sediment macroinvertebrate community contained two dominant functional groups: predators (tanypodinae) and tube-building collectors (chironominae).  To test the effect of functional diversity on sediment organic matter processing (measured as sediment oxygen demand; SOD), we established chironomid communities at natural densities in 0.47 L mesocosms.  The different communities were: no chironomids (control), predator, collector, predator + collector. SOD was measured using Winkler titration over a 7 day period.  We found that the presence of the collector functional group significantly elevated SOD, regardless of the presence of the predator.  These results suggest that the processing and storage of sediment organic matter is affected by the functional diversity of the macroivertebrate community, and that changes to macroinvertebrate diversity can have implications for how small ponds affect the carbon cycle.  

## Description

This abstract describes the results of the expriments that I completed with the SRF program at DePauw University with Alicia Whitney and Clare Hasken.  We evaluated the effect of functional diversity in chironomid communities on SOD, Chl _a_, and bacterial abundance in the quarry pond in DePauw's nature park.
