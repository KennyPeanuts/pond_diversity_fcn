# Summary of CPOM sampling methods from select literature

I read the methods of each of the papers that we had collected thus far and determined if they collected sediment and macroinvertebrates.  If they did I determined whether the OM samples were preserved and how the bugs were removed from the samples.  For most of the studies there was no preservation of the sample and the bugs were picked live but these tended to be larger shredder species.  Formalin seemed to be the most common preservation method and only one study used ethanol but this was after an initial formalin preservation.  

For samples with mainly small macroinvertebrates (e.g., chironominae) there seems to be 3 options:

1) Take separate OM and bug samples - this method fails to specifically associate community structure with the OM sample.

2) Live-pick the sample and preserve the bugs only - this method runs the risk of missing small taxa.

3) Preserve the sample and separate the OM from the bugs in the lab - this method risks introducing preservation artifacts to the OM mass assessment

I have conducted a more comprehensive literature search on leaf litter decomposition experiments in lakes and will expand the table when I have gone through them.
