Turner. 2010. Species-Specific effects of gastropods on leaf litter processing in pond mesocosms. Hydrobiologia 651: 93-100.</h1>
<p>The authors evaluate the effect of 6 different species of lentic snails on red maple litter breakdown in 400 L mesocosms and the effect of a single sp of snail (<em>Stagnicola elodes</em>) on the decay of 5 litter species. All of the incubations were single species.</p>
<p>Red maple leaf mass loss without snails was 0.142 d<sup>-1</sup> and increased by 27 to 39% in the presence of the two snails species with the greatest effects (both variants of <em>S. elodes</em>). Three of the 6 species had no effect on the mass loss of the red maple leaves.</p>
<p><em>S. elodes</em> significantly increased the mass loss of the leaves for all species except American Beech. Mass lost increased between 25 and 72% in the presence of <em>S. elodes</em>.</p>
