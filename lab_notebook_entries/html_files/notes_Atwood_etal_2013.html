<h2 id="hypothesis">Hypothesis</h2>
<p>The authors predict that the presence of predators will enhance PPR and reduce litter mineralization via the reduction of herbivores and shredders, respectively. The net effect of this will be a reduction in CO<sub>2</sub> production via decomposition and an enhancement of CO<sub>2</sub> uptake via PPR which would result in less CO<sub>2</sub> flux from the system.</p>
<h2 id="study-system">Study System</h2>
<p>Ponds - 10 small (2.16 m<sup>2</sup> experimental ponds in Canada</p>
<ul>
<li>Predator - <em>Gasterosteus aculeatus</em> (Three spined stickleback)</li>
</ul>
<p>Streams - 6 experimental streams in Canada (sa = 7.52 m<sup>2</sup>)</p>
<ul>
<li>Predator - <em>Hesperoperla pacifica</em> (stonefly)</li>
</ul>
<p>Bromeliad 20 mesocosms (sa = 0.02 m<sup>2</sup>)</p>
<ul>
<li>Predator <em>Mecistogaster modesta</em> (damselfly)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="results">Results</h2>
<p>Across all 3 systems predators:</p>
<ul>
<li>reduced prey biomass by 75 +(-) 67%</li>
<li>reduced detrital mass loss by 47 +(-) 10%</li>
<li>increased algal biomass by 65 +(-) 15%</li>
<li>decreased CO<sub>2</sub> concentration in the water by 42 +(-) 23%</li>
<li>decreased CO<sub>2</sub> flux by 93 +(-) 44%</li>
</ul>
<p>The pond systems were algal based systems, so the effect was apparently due to the release of PPR, the streams and bromelaiads were detrital based systems and so the effect was due to the reduction in OM mineralization. This was evident in the changes of CO<sub>2</sub> flux from the systems. In the ponds the presence of predators resulted in a flux of ~1 gC m<sup>-2</sup> d<sup>-1</sup> <em>into</em> the pond and no flux when the predators were absent. On the other hand there was a greater flux of CO<sub>2</sub> when the predators were absent than when they were present <em>out of</em> the stream (~10 vs 1 gC m<sup>-2</sup> d<sup>-1</sup>) and bromeliad (~43 vs 25 gC m<sup>-2</sup> d<sup>-1</sup>)</p>
<p>The authors show that predators can reduce CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from aquatic systems when a trophic cascade is present.</p>
<h2 id="questions">Questions</h2>
<ul>
<li>What is the effect of predators in the absence of a demonstrated trophic cascade?</li>
<li>How does the OM quality change as a result of the different mechanisms?</li>
<li>How would this work in a pond system supported by allochthonous OM and a decomposer fauna that is not preyed upon by fish?</li>
<li>What is the relationship between benthic and pelagic processes wrt CO<sub>2</sub> flux?</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="observations-on-my-systems">Observations on my systems</h3>
<p>The ponds in this area are not likely to experience the same kind of strong trophic cascades. It is not clear that the decomposer fauna would be that influenced by fish predation. Cursory observations do not show big differences in the abundance of benthic macroinvertebrates in the WL (fish) and LPP (no fish - I think), although the systems are rather different. I would hypothesize that the presence of fish predators would not have the large effect that was observed in these systems. However, the functional diversity of the system may have more of an effect through the effect of bioturbation and different lifestyles of sediment dwelling organisms.</p>
