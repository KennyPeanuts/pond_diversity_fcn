T., R. Aerts, and J. H. C. Cornelissen. 2012. Multiple mechanisms for trait effects on litter decomposition: moving beyond home-field advantage with a new hypothesis. Journal of Ecology 100:619-630</h1>
<p>The authors test a hypothesis regarding the effects of litter quality being decomposed relative to the overall litter quality of the site. They hypothesize that litter decomposition rate should be greatest for litter types that match the average quality of the litter at the site (i.e., high quality litter in a pond should breakdown faster than high quality litter in soils).</p>
<p>The authors test this hypothesis across 3 different boreal habitats with different mean litter quality: a pond, a forest wetland, and forest soils in Sweden. Litter of 3 different qualities were incubated in each site and decomposition measured.</p>
<p>Litter quality, site quality and their interaction were all relevant but no hypothesis consistently predicted the decay rate. There were 14 litter types tested:</p>
<ul>
<li>2 types did not show any significant differences between sites</li>
<li>6 types showed effects of litter quality and site quality but no interaction between them</li>
<li>5 types showed the greatest decay rate when the litter quality matched the average litter quality of the site, regardless of its source</li>
<li>1 type showed the greatest decay rate when the litter was from the same site (but in this case the quality also matched)</li>
</ul>
