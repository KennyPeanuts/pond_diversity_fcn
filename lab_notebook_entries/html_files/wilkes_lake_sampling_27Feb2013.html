<h3 id="goal-sampling-design">Goal/ Sampling Design</h3>
<p>The goal of the sampling was to continue collecting data to assess the relationship between CPOM and macroinvertebrate functional diversity.</p>
<p>The sampling design was to collect 3 replicate Ekman samples from a <em>littoral</em> section of the lake, an <em>open shallow</em> section, and a <em>open deep</em> section. The <em>littoral</em> and <em>open shallow</em> sections were intended to be similar in depth and therefore similar physical environments but represent a gradient of CPOM inputs. The <em>deep</em> sample was intended to capture the effect of focussing on CPOM distribution.</p>
<p>The <em>littoral</em> and <em>open shallow</em> samples were collected on 2013-Feb-20</p>
<h3 id="sampling-location-site-description">Sampling Location &amp; Site Description</h3>
<p>We put the boat in on the N shore of the lake at the beach adjacent to the parking lot. The bottom drops off quickly at this site to approximately 2 m and remains at 2 m across the entire lake. Heading E in the lake the bottom very gradually slopes up toward the outflow on the E end of the lake but overall the lake was astonishingly uniform in depth (between 1.5 and 2 m)</p>
<h4 id="sample-data">Sample Data</h4>
<p>Additional depth information showed that there really is no deep spot in the lake. So the <em>deep</em> samples were basically more <em>open</em> samples taken more toward the E end of the lake (near the retaining walls on the S shore). Replicates A and B were taken at approximately the same spot and replicate C was collected on a separate boat trip.</p>
<p>Interestingly, samples A and C looked very similar and had a high clay content with abundant CPOM in the form of black leaf fragments. Sample B, despite being taken near sample A had a much higher sand content and a lower volume of mud, suggesting a harder bottom.</p>
<p>Oligochaetes and chironomus were seen during sample washing.</p>
<pre><code>Site          Dist. from shore    Depth
----------------------------------------
open (A &amp; B)  approx middle       1.9 m
open (C)      approx middle       1.9 m


Secchi depth = 0.6 m </code></pre>
<h3 id="sample-processing">Sample Processing</h3>
<p>We did not collect the LOI samples.</p>
<p>All of the samples were washed through 250 Î¼m nets and preserved in 70% EtOH in the field.</p>
