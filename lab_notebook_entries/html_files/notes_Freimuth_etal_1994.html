Bass. 1994. Physiochemical conditions and larval chironomidae (Diptera) of an urban pond. Proceedings of the Oklahoma Academy of Science 74:11-16.</h1>
<p>Eutrophic urban pond in OK</p>
<p>Collected 30 benthic taxa from 2871 individuals over a year of monthly sampling</p>
<p>Community was overall 48% Procladius, 13.4% Chironomus sp, and 10.3% Cladopelma sp</p>
<p>Procladius was always dominant except in Oct. when the emerge and then Chironominae (Chironomus and Cladopelma) dominated</p>
<p>Chironominae comprised 50% of community in July and 80% in Oct.</p>
<p>Orthocladinae was only found in April and was 0.4% of community</p>
<p>Shannon diversity was greatest in Oct, which the authors attribute to the input of leaf litter</p>
<p>The littoral samples had higher diversity than the open-water samples, which the authors atribute to the greater amount of CPOM in the littoral zone and thus the greater amount of habitat complexity</p>
<p>Littoral samples were more similar to each other than to open samples</p>
