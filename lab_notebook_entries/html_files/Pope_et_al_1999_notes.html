Leaf litter colonization by invertebrates in the littoral zone of a small oligotrophic lake. Hydrobiologia 392:99-112</h1>
<p>The authors evaluate the macroinvertebrate colonization of leaf packs and the leaf decay rate in the littoral zone of an oligotrophic lake in Ontario, Canada. The lake is 28 ha and sub-boreal</p>
<h2 id="methods">Methods</h2>
<p>The authors conduct 2 leaf-pack studies where 5 g leaf packs of Maple, Beech and Maple + Beech were place in the littoral zone of the lake for approx. 1 yr.</p>
<p>The first study used fall shed leaves and the second study used conditioned leaves found in the spring</p>
<h2 id="results">Results</h2>
<p>There was no difference in the richness of macros collected from the different leaf species in the fall or spring leaf experiments</p>
<pre><code>Total richness 
           Maple    Beech    M + B 
Fall       40       38       38
Spring     nr       48       42</code></pre>
<p>Invertebrate abundance (number per g remaining leaf) was greatest at the end of the experiments and increased initially but remained fairly level through the winter (under the ice) for both the spring and the fall leaves.</p>
<p>Chironomids made up 35 - 95% of total abundance on the fall leaves and 72% of the abundance on the spring leaves</p>
<p>As a result the leaf packs were dominated by collector taxa numerically - however some large shredders were found and may have been more important by biomass</p>
<p>The mass loss followed normal exponential decay: Table of k values for the treatments - before and after leaching refer to the parts of the curve with or without the initial 2 d submersion</p>
