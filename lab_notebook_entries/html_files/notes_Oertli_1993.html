<p>Woodland ponds share many characteristics of other littoral systems: have same substrates (macrophytes, litter, mud)</p>
<h2 id="study-site">Study Site</h2>
<ul>
<li>Man-made pond, constructed in 1969</li>
<li>4400 m<sup>2</sup>, mean Z = 0.8 m, max Z = 2 m</li>
<li>surrounded by deciduous forest</li>
<li>Substrate by area 25% leaf litter, 13% sub. macrophytes, 28% emergent macrophytes</li>
<li>Leaf litter accumulation patchy; max values = 180 - 1400 g m<sup>-2</sup> y<sup>-1</sup></li>
</ul>
<p>The authors estimate oak leaf decay and macroinvertebrate production in leaf packs as well as in chara and Typha beds in a small forested impoundment.</p>
<p>Oak leaf decay constant = -0.0014, 32% of leaf mass remained after one year so leaves represented a consistent habitat throughout the year.</p>

<p>Predator density was 6% of total but 12% of total production</p>
<p><strong>Shredders consumed only 19% of leaf mass (post leaching), 81% of the leaf mass lost due to microbial processing.</strong> This is much smaller than is typically seen in streams.</p>
