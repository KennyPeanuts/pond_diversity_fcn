<p>This study addressed the effects of retaining walls and swimming beaches on the trophic structure of lake littoral zones in 3 German lakes.</p>
<p>The shoreline development reduced the habitat complexity of the littoral zone such that the beaches only contained FPOM, CPOM, and SPOM (suspended particulate OM), while the undisturbed habitats contained 10 different habitat/resource types. <em>[They confound their habitats and basal resources in their descriptions (e.g., FPOM on reed vs. FPOM on sand) plus they add some non-resource habitats (e.g., concrete)]</em></p>
<p>There was no relationship between habitat diversity and consumer biomass but there was a positive relationship between habitat diversity and trophic links (0-10 for beaches, 35-70 for undisturbed), number of food resources (2-4 for beaches, 6-8 for undisturbed), and number of consumer taxa (2-6 for beaches, 8-18 for undisturbed). Retaining walls were intermediate for all responses.</p>
<p>The only consumers on the beaches were:</p>
<ul>
<li>chironominae</li>
<li>fingernail clams</li>
<li>snails</li>
<li>oligochaets</li>
<li>mussels</li>
<li>amphipod</li>
</ul>
<p>The stable isotopes show that in the beaches the consumer resources come from:</p>
<pre><code>Source  Percent
---------------
FPOM    60
CPOM    15
SPOM    25</code></pre>
<p>In the undisturbed habitat the cosumers rely much more on CPOM and less on FPOM:</p>
<pre><code>Source  Percent
---------------
FPOM    40 
CPOM    30
SPOM    20
peri    10</code></pre>
<p>The shoreline development reduced the habitat complexity and thus the resource and trophic complexity of the littoral zone. Furthermore there was less connection to the riparian zone through CPOM. <em>Although the authors do not indicate the source of the FPOM in the developed portions of the lake, this may be coming from CPOM breakdown in the undisturbed littoral zones.</em></p>
