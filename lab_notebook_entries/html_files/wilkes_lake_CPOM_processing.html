<p>Originally the CPOM was picked from the washed samples by hand and we were estimating which fragments were greater than 1 mm. This was inefficient and inaccurate.</p>
<p>To correct and standardize this process we rinsed the picked fraction of the samples though a 1 mm sieve after all of the macroinvertebrates were removed and placed any retained OM into the CPOM sample weigh boat to be dried at 50<sup>o</sup> C.</p>
<p>Future samples will be washed through the 1 mm sieve to separate them into a fine and coarse fraction before they are picked.</p>
