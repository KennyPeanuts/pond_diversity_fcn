## Notes

The ergosterol samples were shipped 13 Jan 2015 overnight to Vlad at Coastal Carolina

The attached spreadsheet has the data for the samples.  Here is a description of what the in the Ergostero_saples.xlxs file columns mean:

~~~~

Bottle_Number = the identifying number of the BOD bottle that was used during the experimental incubations
Date_Collected = the date that the samples were put into the methanol
Sample_Type = the type of organic matter in the sample
Treatment = the treatment designations:
    CN = with 20 leaf discs and added N and P
    C0 = with 20 leaf discs and ambient nutrients
    0N = with added nutrients and no leaf discs
    00 = with no leaf discs and ambient nutrients
Replicate = the treatment replicate number

Est_sed_mass = the mean of the dry mass of the replicate 0.5 ml sediment cores taken at the same time as the
0.5 ml sediment core preserved in methanol in mg

Est_sed_AFDM = the AFDM mass of a replicate 0.5 ml sediment core taken at the same time as the 0.5 ml sediment core preserved in methanol in mg

Est_leaf_mass = the mean of the dry mass of a single leaf disc taken at the same time as the
leaf discs preserved in methanol in mg

Est_leaf_AFDM = the AFDM mass of a single leaf disc taken at the same time as the leaf discs preserved in methanol in mg

~~~~

The samples are in 10 ml of methanol.
