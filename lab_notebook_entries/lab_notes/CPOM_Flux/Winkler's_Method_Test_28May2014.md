## Samples

The trials will be run using the reagents created on Feb. 20 & 27, 2014, and May 28, 2014

## Purpose

To test the effectiveness of the Winkler's method and the reagents we created.

## Lab observations and data

Procedure outline for 10 ml serum bottles:

-Sample collection:
	1. Collect ~10 ml into volume calibrated serum vial by overfilling by 0.5 times the volume
	2. Cap vial to get correct volume
	3. Immediately add 85 microliters of MnCl solution and 85 microliters of NaOH/NaI solution and cap
	4. Shake and allow precipitate to form and settle three times while keeping the bottle in the dark
	5.Add 85 microliters of 10 N H2SO4 and shake
	6. Titrate with Sodium Thiosulfate unil pale yellow, then add 1 drop of starch solution and titrate until blue color disappears
-Standardization of Sodium Thiosulfate:
	1.Add 85 microliters of KIO3 solution to serum vial
	2. Nearly fill serum vial with DI water
	3. Add 85 microliters of 10N H2SO4
	4. Add 85 microliters of NaOH/ NaI sodium
	5. Titrate with sodium thiosulfate until pale yellow, then add 1 drop starch solution and titrate until blue color disppears
	6. Repeat 3 to 5 times and use mean in calculations
-Blank Determination:
	1. Add 85 microliters of KIO3 solution to BOD bottle
	2. Nearly fill BOD bottle with DI water
	3. Add 85 microliters of 10N H2SO4
	4. Add 85 microliters of NaOH/NaI solution and mix
	5. Add 85 microliters of MnCl solution
	6. Titrate with Sodium Thiosulfate until pale yellow, and then add 1 drop of starch solution and titrate until blue color disappears
	7. Add 85 microliters KIO3 solution
	8. Titrate with sodium thiosulfate until pale yellow, then add 1 drop starch solution and titrate until blue color disappears
	9. Calculate difference between 1st and 2nd titrations as Rblk (this may be negative)

DATA 

-Blank Determination was not performed and no calucations and/or data was collected for each run
	-This trial was purely to practice the method outlined above and to test the effectiveness of the method
