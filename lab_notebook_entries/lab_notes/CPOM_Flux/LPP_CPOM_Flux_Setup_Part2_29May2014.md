## Samples

Location: Lancer Park Pond

## Purpose

1. Collect sediments for BOD bottles
2. Measure CPOM density in LPP
3. Measure nutrients in LPP

## Lab observations and data

Procedure for sediment collection:
1. Collect replicate Ekman samples from LPP litoral
2. Sieve sediments through 250 micrometer mesh and retain in buckets
3. Gently add overlying water collected from near the sediment depth
	-Each jar contains 100 ml of sediment so it needs 200 ml of water
	-We need to collect 3200 ml of water

Procedure for CPOM Density:
1. Collect ekman from littoral
2. In field, pass sediments through 250 micrometer sieve (retain sieved sediments for BOD bottles)
3. Collect retained material in 1 L bottles
4. In lab, pass retained material through a 1 mm sieve and collect CPOM >1mm into a pre-weighted paper bag
5. Dry CPOM at 50 degrees Celcius, weigh and ash at 550 degrees to determine ash-free dry mass (AFDM)

DATA 

1. Sediment volume calculations:
	-BOD diameter = 6 cm
	-BOD radius = 3 cm
h = 100 cc/ (pi*3cm^2)  -> h = 3.5 cm
v = [pi*(r^2)*h]  -> (v/h) = [pi*(r^2)]  -> (1/h) = [(pi*(r^2))/v]  -> h = [v/(pi*(r^2))]
So if we put 100 ml of sediment into each bottle it will = 3.5cm of sediment.
	-We need a total of 1600 ml of sediment
