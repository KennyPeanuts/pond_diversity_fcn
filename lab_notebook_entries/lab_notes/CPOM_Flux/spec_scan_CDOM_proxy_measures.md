# Notes on the processing of the spec scan data

## Methods from Leech et al. Chowan River Paper

> The ratio of absorbance at 254 nm to 365 nm was calculated to track changes in the relative size of CDOM molecules (modified from De Haan and De Boer 1987). The ratio decreases as molecular size increases due to stronger light absorption at longer wavelengths by high-molecular-weight CDOM.  This ratio is also used as a proxy for photodegradability (Dalrymple et al. 2010), with increasing 254:365 ratios suggesting increased photodegradation of CDOM.  Specific UV absorbance at 254 nm (SUVA254) was calculated by dividing the UV absorbance at 254 nm (m-1) by the DOC concentration (mg L-1) and was used as a proxy for estimating CDOM aromaticity (Weishaar et al. 2003).  As SUVA254 increases, aromaticity increases, indicating CDOM inputs from terrestrial sources.  Spectral slopes between 275 – 295 nm (S275-295) and 350 – 400 nm (S350-400) were determined by applying a linear fit to natural log-transformed spectral absorbance data corresponding to each spectral range.  These ranges provide information regarding CDOM source, structure, and diagenesis (e.g., photobleaching, microbial degradation) (Helms et al. 2008).  S275-295 is used as a proxy for molecular weight, with decreases in slope indicating increases in molecular weight, while the ratio of S275-295 to S350-400 (SR) is used to characterize changes in CDOM source and character. The lower the SR value, the more allochthonous the sample, the higher molecular weight CDOM, the less photodegraded (Helms et al. 2014).  Specifically, SR values less than one signify CDOM of terrestrial origin (Helms et al. 2008).  Finally, absorbance at 350 nm was used as an estimate of CDOM concentration (a350) (Moran et al. 2000) while the ratio of absorbance at 350 nm to DOC concentration (a350:DOC) was used to estimate the contribution of CDOM to the larger DOC pool (Moran et al. 2000).

## Summary of Leech et al.

* CDOM molecular weight increases as the 254:365 nm decreases

* Spectral slope = the linear fit of the log transformed absorbance between 275 and 295 nm or between 350 and 400 nm.  

    * S275-295 decreases with increasing molecular weight
    * SR = the ratio of S275-295 to S350-400.  SR less than 1 indicate terrestrial derived CDOM
