## Samples

Sediment samples and leaf disks from the CPOM Flux experiment preformed during PRISM 2014

## Purpose

The samples were collected from the jars at the end of the experiment and are being sent to Matt Waters at Valdosta State University for total C and N analysis. 

* Each "leaf" sample is made up of 4 randomly chosen leaf disks, dried at 50 dC and then ground and homogenized.
* Each "surface sediment"sample is a 1 cm deep and 0.8 cm diameter core taken from the sediment at the bottom of the bottle, dried at 50 dC, ground, and homogenized.
* Each "bulk sediment" sample is a 0.8 cm diameter core taken for the whole depth of the sediment column in the bottle, dried at 50 dC, ground, and homogenized.

## Samples

Key: 

* C = added 20, 10 mm leaf disks
* N = added inorganic N and P
* 0 = not added
