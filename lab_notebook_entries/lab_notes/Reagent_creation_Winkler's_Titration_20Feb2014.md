DATA 

1. Manganous Chloride solution (3M)
	-Volume: 100 ml
	-Formula: 60 MnCl2 * 4 H2O -> 100 ml DI
2. Alkaline Iodide solution (8N NaOH, 4M NaI)
	-Volume: 100 ml
	-Formula: 32g NaOH + 60g NaI -> 50 ml DI (Cool and then bring to 100 ml)
3. Sulfuric Acid solution (10N)
	-Volume: 500 ml
	-Formula: 140 ml cH2SO4 + 200 ml DI (Cool and bring to 500 ml)
4. Stock Sodium Thiosulfate solution
	-Volume: 500 ml
	-Formula: 175g Na2S2O3 * 5H2O -> 500 ml DI
