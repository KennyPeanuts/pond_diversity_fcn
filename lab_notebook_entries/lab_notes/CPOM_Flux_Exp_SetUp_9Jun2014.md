# Lab Notes for CPOM Flux Exp Set Up

## Purpose

We set up the bottles for the CPOM Flux experiment and assigned the treatment levels to the bottles

## Procedures and observations

Each bottle had been prepared before with mud and water see Sediment_BOD_Jar_Setup_30May2014.md

From these bottles 150 ml of overlying water was removed with a syringe

The treatments getting CPOM had 20, 10 mm leaf discs added. The leaf discs were cut from tulip poplar leaves that were collected at senescence during the fall of 2013 and air dried. The leaves were briefly rewetted in di water before they were cut with a cork borer

150 ml of lake water (or nutrient treatment water where appropriate) was then added back to the bottles with a syringe.

The bottles were then placed haphazardly on the rocker shakers in the dark with speed = 8 and tilt = 8

## Treatments

The treatment levels were randomly assigned to the bottles
