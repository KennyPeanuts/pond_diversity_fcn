## Lab observations and data

1. After each crucible was filled, it was stored in the drier.
2. Due to the amount of time that the samples took to crush, the samples were crushed on May 27 and stored in the drier overnight.
3. On May 28, the samples were placed into the furnace at 9:40 a.m., at an initial temperature of ~300 degrees Celcius, and removed from the furnace at 3:06 p.m.
