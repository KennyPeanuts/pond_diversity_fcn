## Samples

Location: Lancer Park Pond

Samples: 
	A and B (1m depth, ~10 m from shore)
	C and D (0.4 m depth, closer to inlet)

## Purpose

To sort throught the sample(s) until only CPOM is remaining.

## Lab observations and data

-To process each of the samples, a sample would be poured onto a 1mm strainer and rinsed thoroughly. 
	-Any macroinvertebrates found in the samples were removed. 
-Anything that did not pass through the strainer was put into brown paper bags and moved into the drier. 
-An interesting note, all macroinvertebrates found in Sample B were dead.
