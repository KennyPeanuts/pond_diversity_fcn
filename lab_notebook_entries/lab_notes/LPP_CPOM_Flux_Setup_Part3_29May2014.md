## Samples

Location: Lancer Park Pond

## Purpose

To determine the CPOM density 

## Lab observations and data

LPP Chlorophyl analysis: Water given to Dina Leech to perform
	-Chlorophyl a analysis
	-Spec scans
	-3-D fluoremetry(?)
Nutrient analysis:
	-Dina filtered 50 ml of the collected water through GFF- this water is used for the nutrient analyses
NO2-NO3 Analysis:
	-N was tested using Hach Test kit N1-12 (cat# 14081-00) using the provided instructions
	-Nitrate: read as bd - no color developed 
		-This appears to be <8.8 mg/L
	-Nitrite: read as bd - no color developed
		-This is <0.066mg/L
	-Ammonia: read as bd - color was yellow
		-This is <0.2 mg/L 
	-Ortho Phospate: read as bd - no color developed
		-This is <0.2 mg/L
