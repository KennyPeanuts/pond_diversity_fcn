# Sediment Dry Mass + AFDM

## Date

30 May 2014

## Author

## Samples

Location: Lancer Park Pond

## Purpose

To determine the dry mass per volume and OM content of the slurry used to fill the BOD bottles

## Lab observations and data

Methods:
-Sediments were collected from LPP on 29 May 2014 from 1m and 0.4m
-The sediments were sieved through 250 micrometers mesh in the field, and the 1m and 0.4m samples were mixed in a 5 gal bucket
-The slurry was allowed to settle overnight and then the overlying water was siphoned off
-10ml of slurry wass added to pre-weighed crucibles and dried at 50 degrees Celcius
-The dry sediments were ashed at 550 degrees Celcius
