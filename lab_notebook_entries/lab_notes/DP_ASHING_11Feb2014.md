## Purpose

The sample leaves were crushed with a mortar and pestle and placed into the furnace at 550 degrees Celcius for approximately 4 hours.

## Lab observations and data

1. After each crucible was filled, it was stored in the drier.
2. Due to the amount of time it took to crush all 10 samples, I waited until the afternoon of 12 February 2014 to place the crucibles into the muffle furnace.
3. The samples were placed into the furnace around 2:30 p.m. but had to be removed at 3:20 p.m. due to inclement weather (Dr. Fortino).
4. The samples were then stored in the drying oven until the lab could once again be accessed.
5. The samples were finally able to finish their time in the muffle furnace on 17 Febraury 2014 (Leanna Tacik).
6. They were left in the furnace from 3:00pm-7:00 pm.
