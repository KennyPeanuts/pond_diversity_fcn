## Samples

Location: Lancer Park Pond

## Purpose

To fill the replicate jars with the necessary mud and water. (Before addition of nutrients and/or CPOM)

## Lab observations and data

Methods:
1. The BOD bottles were rinsed thoroughly with DI water
2. The mud that was collected from Lancer Park Pond on 29 May 2014 was allowed to settle overnight, and then the over-lying water was carefully siphoned off.
3. After being stirred gently, 100 ml of the remaining slurry was added to each BOD bottle.
4. Once all 16 jars were filled with slurry, a siphon was created using a rubber tube to fill the remaining volume in each BOD bottle (~200 ml) with water.
	The water used was from the samples that been gathered from Lancer Park Pond on May 29, 2014.
5. Each jar was then capped, the excess water removed from the rim with a plastic pipette, uncapped, and placed on the rocker-shaker.
6. The rocker-shakers were set on 8 speed, 5 tilt, and placed in a darkened, covered box.
