## Samples

Randomly selected tulip poplar leaves (from storage box) 

## Purpose

To determine the OM content of the tulip poplar leaf to disks to use in the flux experiment

## Lab observations and data

Methods:
-5 leaves were randomly selected from the tulip poplar leaves collected Fall 2013
-Each leaf was gently submersed in DI water until it was soft enough to core (~5 minutes)
-A single leaf disk (10 mm; #5 cork borer) was cut from the the leaf blade avoiding the midrib
-The dish was placed into a pre-weighed crucible and dried at 50 degrees Celcius, then ashed at 550 degrees Celcius
