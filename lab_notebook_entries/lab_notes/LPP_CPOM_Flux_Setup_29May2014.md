## Samples

Location: Lancer Park Pond

## Purpose

Re-assess the original protocal and modify as necessary

## Lab observations and data

Changes to the original protocol:

-The septum-top jars could not be filled reliably without introducing air so we switched to using the BOD bottles (300 ml)
-The rocker-shakers can only support a total of 8 BOD bottles each so we had to reduce the number of replicates to 4 per treatment for a total of 16 bottles
