# Notes on Hillebrand, H. and B. Matthiessen. 2009. Biodiversity in a complex world: consolidation and progress in functional biodiversity research. Ecology Letters 12: 1405-1419.

## Introduction

* General effect of diversity loss = 
    + reduction in ecosystem process rates
    + reduction in resource use efficiency
    + accelerated reductions in above with time
    + reduction is aspects of stability

* This consensus is developed from experiments without biological complexity and thus leave open questions of:
    + direct and indirect effect of diversity on process
    + mechanisms of additive vs emergent effects in actual communities

* Species richness may be a poor variable for diversity/function questions
    + human activities tend to alter evenness and beta diversity before local richness
    + richness is only one point in the diversity hierarchy from genetic diversity to functional diversity
        - functional diversity can be measured as a cont. measure of trait diversity
        - functional traits = any aspect of biology that affects individual performance
        - functional diversity explicitly includes identity

* Diversity effects on the sum of all ecosystem processes > diversity effects on single ecosystem functions
