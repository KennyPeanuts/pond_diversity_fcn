Description: 

These data were collected to measure sediment oxygen demand in the CPOM Flux Experiment. 100 ml of sediments from Lancer Park Pond were incubated with or without 20 tulip poplar leaf disks and with or without nutrient (NO3, NH4, and PO4) additions in 300 ml BOD bottles. To measure SOD, the DO concentration was measured at T0 and then the bottles were sealed without air and the DO concentration was measured at TF.  DO was measured using Winkler Titrations.
