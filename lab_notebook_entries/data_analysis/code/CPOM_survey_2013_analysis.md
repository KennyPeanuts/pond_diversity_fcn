## Data Analysis

### Research Questions

1) What is the density of CPOM in the study ponds?

2) How does the density of CPOM vary among ponds?

3) How does the density of CPOM vary within ponds?
     a. Littoral vs Open Habitats
     b. Within Littoral and Open Habitats

4) Does the density of CPOM vary with date (WL only)?

5) Is there a relationship between CPOM and percent OM in the sediments?

The data show that for all of the samples the density of CPOM is mainly under 100 mg AFDM / m^2 however there are local patches of higher CPOM with densities between 200 and 600 mg AFDM / m^2.

This is not due to differences in then location of the samples since there are 30 open and 24 littoral samples.

There is potentially a bias introduced by the lakes because most of the samples come from WL and the least from LPP

The ANOVA with ln transformation shows a significant model and Tukeys HSD shows that LPP has more CPOM than WC, otherwise the CPOM density in the ponds is not significantly different.

The results of individual lakes suports the hypothesis that the density of CPOM is generally less than 0.05 - 0.1 g / m^2 with a few locations going much higher than that.

The results show that there is significantly more CPOM in the littoral locations than in the open locations. However virtually all of the densities are below 100 mg AFDM / m^2

Overall the sediment organic matter ranges from between 8 and 13% but there is a cluster of samples with <5% organic matter and a cluster of samples with >20% organic matter.  It is likely that the low percent organic matter samples, are those that were very sandy.

There are differences in the way that sediment OM is distributed among the lakes.  The two catch-basin lakes (LPP and WC) have the most homogeneous sediment organic matter with virtually all samples falling between 10 and 15% sediment OM.  WL has the lowest sediment OM with virtually all samples falling below 10%.  DP shows a bimodal distribution with a 2 samples under 10% and 4 samples over 20%, so overall DP has the greatest sediment OM.

Overall there is not a big difference between the littoral and open locations the cluster of high sediment OM in DP is from the open habitat. There were samples with low percent OM from both the littoral and open habitats.
