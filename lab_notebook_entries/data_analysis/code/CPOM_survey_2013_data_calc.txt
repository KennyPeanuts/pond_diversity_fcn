### Description: 

These data represent the compilation of all of the CPOM density data and sediment LOI data collected during the spring 2013 semester and the 2013 PRISM project.  

During the late winter and spring, the samples were collected from LPP and WL in the littoral zone and open regions of the ponds. A single replicate sample was collected from 3 unique locations in each pond on each date.

During the summer sampling in WL, DP, and WC, 2 replicate samples were taken from each of 3 unique locations in the littoral and open parts of the lake.  The descriptions of the sampling locations are in the field notebook.

The samples were collected from each lake using an Ekman dredge and placed into a plastic bin.  Once on shore, the sediments were homogenized and a sample was collected in a 20 ml glass scintillation vial.
