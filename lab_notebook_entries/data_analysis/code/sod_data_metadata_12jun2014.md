# CPOM Flux Experiment Sediment Oxygen Demand Data

## 12 June 2014

## Metadata

Collected by: KP

Affiliation: Longwood University

Description: 

These data were collected to measure sediment oxygen demand in the CPOM Flux Experiment. 100 ml of sediments from Lancer Park Pond were incubated with or without 20 tulip poplar leaf disks and with or without nutrient (NO3, NH4, and PO4) additions in 300 ml BOD bottles. To measure SOD, the DO concentration was measured at T0 and then the bottles were sealed without air and the DO concentration was measured at TF.  DO was measured using Winkler Titrations.

### Variables:

* bod = the identifying number of the BOD bottle
* vialT0 = the identifying number of the 10 ml vial initially used to collect water (before replacement water was added and the bod bottle sealed)
* vialTF = the identifying number of the 10 ml vial used to collect water at time T1 (after unsealing the bod bottle)
* CPOM = description of whether or not CPOM was present in the sample
* Nutrient = description of whether or not the sample was nutrient enriched
* temp = the incubation temperature (in degrees Celcius)
* pressure = the atmospheric pressure (in Hg)
* time0 = the time that replacement water was added and the bod bottle was sealed (y-m-d H:M)
* RmeasT0 = sample titration buret reading at "time 0" (ml) - This "time 0" refers to the sample that was collected from the bod bottle prior to replacement water being added
* timeF = the time that the BOD bottle was sampled after the incubation (y-m-d H:M) -Sample collected after the replacement water was added and the bod bottle sealed
* RmeasTF = the sample titration buret reading at time F (ml)
* A = the area of the sediments in the BOD bottle (m2)
* Replvol = the volume of water added back in to the BOD bottle before it is sealed (L)
* BODwatervol = the total volume of water in the BOD bottle once it is sealed (L)
