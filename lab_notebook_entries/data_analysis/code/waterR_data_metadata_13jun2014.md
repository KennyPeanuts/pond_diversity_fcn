# CPOM Flux Experiment Water Respitration Data

## 13 June 2014

## Metadata

Collected by: KP 

Affiliation: Longwood University

Description: 

These data were collected to measure the respiration of the water in the CPOM Flux Experiment. 100 ml of sediments from Lancer Park Pond were incubated with or without 20 tulip poplar leaf disks and with or without nutrient (NO3, NH4, and PO4) additions in 300 ml BOD bottles. To measure R in the water overlying the sediments a sample of water was collected without air into a 10 ml vial and then incubated int he dark for approximately 24 hours. The DO concentration of the incubated vial was compared to the DO concentration of the water in the BOD bottle at the T0.  DO was measured using Winkler Titrations.

### Variables:

* bod = the identifying number of the BOD bottle
* vial = the identifying number of the 10 ml vial used to incubate the water.
* CPOM = description of whether or not CPOM was present in the sample
* Nutrient = description of whether or not the sample was nutrient enriched
* temp = the incubation temperature (in degrees Celcius)
* pressure = the atmospheric pressure (in Hg)
* timeF = the time that the BOD bottle was sampled after the incubation (y-m-d H:M) 
* Rmeas = the sample titration buret reading at timeF (ml)
