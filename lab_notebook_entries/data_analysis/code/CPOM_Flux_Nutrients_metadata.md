Description: The raw data of nutrient samples taken from the SOD experiments during summer 2014. These data were run at Virginia Commonwealth Univeristy's laboratory.
The cells highlighted in red are those that had levels of nutrients below detection levels. 
	Detection limits for these samples:
Parameter	MDL/LOD (mg/L)		LOQ (mg/L)
NOx-N		   0.011		   0.046
NH4-N		   0.009		   0.039
ortho-P		   0.016		   0.051
