# Experimental Design of SOD Experiment

## Questions

1. How does CPOM affect respiration in lake sediments?

## Design

### Treatment Levels

1. CPOM alone

2. Sediment alone

3. Sediment + CPOM

4. Lake water alone

### Response Variable

1. SOD

### Measured Variable

1. Overlying water DO concentration

2. Replacement water DO concentration

3. Sediment and/or CPOM OM mass

### Narrative Description

All treatments will be incubated in 250 ml septum top jars and filled with lake water with no head-space. The jars will be incubated in the dark at a constant temperature on a rocker-shaker.  Metabolic rate will be measured as the change in oxygen concentration between successive samplings.  A sample will be collected by piercing the septum with a cannula attached to a length of tubing that will fill a 5 ml serum vial.  Another syringe will then be used to inject 20 ml of replacement water into the vial so that the vial is filled with 3X its volume.  The bottle will be immediately fixed with Winkler's reagents and then titrated using the Winkler method to determine DO.  Sediments would be collected from the lake and washed through 250 um mesh to remove all macroinvertebrates and CPOM.
