# Leaf Decomposition Experiment Design
## Fall 2013
## Longwood University

### Questions

1. What is the rate of leaf decomposition in man-made ponds?
2. Does pond design affect decomposition rate?
3. Does macroinvertebrate colonization affect decomposition rate?
4. Does macroinvertebrate colonization of litter differ between lakes and with decomposition state?

### Experimental Design

#### Treatments

* Pond
    * Dalton Pond
    * Lancer Park Pond
    * LU golf course pond
    * LU campus pond

#### Sampling Frequency

1.  Oct 22 (0 days)
2.  Oct 24 (2 days)
3.  Oct 29 (5 days)
4.  Nov 5  (7 days)
5.  Nov 12 (7 days)
6.  Nov 19 (7 days)
7.  Nov 26 (7 days) 
8.  Dec 3  (14 days)
9.  Dec 17 (14 days)
10. Jan 7  (21 days)
11. Jan 28 (21 days)
12. Feb 18 (21 days)
13. Mar 11 (21 days)
14. Apr 1  (21 days)

#### Replicates

     5 replicate bags per date
     14 dates
     4 lakes
    ---------------
     280 bags 

    70 bags per lake

if each bag contains 5 g dry mass leaves

    280 bags * 5 g = 1400 g leaves

#### Response Variables

##### Measured Variables

1. Leaf AFDM
2. Macroinvertebrate abundance and identity

##### Calculated Variables

1. Leaf decomposition rate (k)
2. Macroinvertebrate &alpha; and &beta; diversity

### Narrative Description

Litter bags will be placed in the littoral zone of each pond in litter bags.  The bags will be filled with 5 g of senescent tulip poplar leaves and will be retrieved over a 6 month period. At each sampling date 5 bags will be randomly selected from each pond.  The bags will be retrieved over a 250 &mu;m mesh net and the contents placed in to a 2 gal zip-lock bag.

Back in the lab, the contents of the litter bag will be gently washed to separate macroinvertebrates from the leaf litter.  The litter will be dried at 50 dC and then ashed at 550 dC to determine AFDM.  The macroinvertebrates will be preserved in 70% EtOH for enumeration and identification.
