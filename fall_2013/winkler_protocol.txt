Micro-Winklers Protocol
protocol modified to 300ml sample from Carpenter 1965. Limnology and Oceanography. 10: 141-143
revised 30 May 2012

* Equipment

** Sample Preparation
1. 300 ml BOD bottle
2. 6X 50 ml beaker 
3. 100 - 1000 ml pipette

** Titration
1. 10 ml buret
2. stir bar
3. magnetic stirrer (top painted white)
4. white background (3-panel display board)
   
* Reagents
Manganous Chloride solution (3M):  
300g MnCl2*4H2O --> 500ml DI

Alkaline Iodide solution (8N NaOH, 4M NaI): 
160g NaOH + 300g NaI --> 200ml DI, cool and bring to 500ml

Sulfuric Acid solution (10N):
slowly add 140ml cH2SO4 to 200ml DI, cool and bring to 500ml

Starch solution (~ 2%):
10g starch boiled into --> 500ml DI

Stock Sodium Thiosulfate solution (1.4N):
175g Na2S2O3*5H2O --> 500ml DI

Working Sodium Thiosulfate solution (0.14N):
10 ml of Stock Thiosulfate solution (1.4N) --> 100 ml DI water

Potassium Iodate solution (0.01N)
0.1780g KIO3 --> 500ml DI 

* Calculations
DO = (((R - Rblk) Vstd * Nstd * E)/(Rstd - Rblk) (Vb - Vreg)) - DOreg
where
DO = dissolved oxygen in ml/L
R = sample titration buret reading (ml)
Rblk = difference between 1st and 2nd blank titration buret readings (ml)
Rstd = standardization titration buret reading (ml)
Vstd = volume of KIO3 standard (ml)
Vb = sample volume (ml)
Vreg = volume of sample displaced by reagents (ml)
Nstd = normality of KIO3 standard (eq/L)
E = 5,598 ml O2 / equivalent 
DOreg = oxygen added with reagents (ml) = 0.018 ml/L O2 per 1 ml of MnCl

* Procedure
1. Collect ~ 300 ml into volume calibrated BOD bottle
2. Immediately add 2.5 ml of MnCl sol. and 2.5 ml of the NaOH/NaI sol. and cap
3. Shake and allow precip to form and settle 3X while keeping the bottle in the dark
4. Add 2.5 ml of 10N H2SO4 and shake
5. Titrate with sodium thiosulfate until pale yellow then add 1 drop starch sol. and titrate until blue color disappears

* Standardization of Sodium Thiosulfate
1. Add 2.5 ml of KIO3 sol. to BOD bottle
2. Nearly fill BOD bottle with DI Water
3. Add 2.5 ml of 10N H2SO4
4. Add 2.5 ml of NaOH/NaI sol.
5. Titrate with sodium thiosulfate until pale yellow then add 1 drop starch sol. and titrate until blue color disappears
6. Repeat 3 to 5 times and use mean in calculations

* Blank Determination
1. Add 2.5 ml KIO3 sol. to BOD bottle 
2. Nearly fill BOD bottle with DI Water
3. Add 2.5 ml of 10N H2SO4
4. Add 2.5 ml of NaOH/NaI sol. and mix
5. Add 2.5 ml of MnCl sol.
6. Titrate with sodium thiosulfate until pale yellow then add 1 drop starch sol. and titrate until blue color disappears
7. Add 2.5 ml KIO3 sol.
8. Titrate with sodium thiosulfate until pale yellow then add 1 drop starch sol. and titrate until blue color disappears
9. Calculate difference between 1st and 2nd titrations as Rblk (this may be negative)
