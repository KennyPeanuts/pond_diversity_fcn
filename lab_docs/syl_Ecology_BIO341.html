<h2>Evaluation and Grading</h2>
<p>
	  The final grade in the course will be determined based on a
      combination of 2 exams (a midterm and a <em>cumulative</em> final exam), a research
      paper, the laboratory grade, and other class assignments (e.g.,
      in&ndash;class writing).  Additional information about each of
      these forms of evaluation will be provided as the class
      progresses and their relative contribution toward the final
      grade is shown below. No grades will be curved and there are no
      opportunities for extra credit.   
</p>
<h3>Exams</h3>
<p>
	  The midterm and final exams will be take&ndash;home exams.  Additional
      details will be provided at the time of the exams but you may
      use any published materials to assist you in completing the
      exam.  You will not be allowed to receive help from any person
      during the exam, including internet&ndash;based question and
      answer sites.
<!-- given during the lab
      meeting time.  You will be given the entire duration of the lab
      to complete the exam.  There will be no make&ndash;up midterm
      exam. If you must miss the exam due to an emergency, the worth
      of the midterm exam will be added to the final exam.-->
</p>
<h3>Research Paper</h3>
<p>
  You will be required to do a reseach paper on a topic relevant to
  the material covered in the course.  Details about the format and
  grading of the paper will be provided during the course.
</p>
<h3>Reading and Other Class Assignments</h3>
<p>
  Readings from Schlesinger 1997 are indicated in the lecture schedule
  above.  You are expected to have read and <em>understood</em> the
  assigned section of the text before coming to class.  We will be
  using the information covered in the readings during the
  lecture portion of the class but information in the readings may
  not be presented during the lecture.  You are responsible
  for all of the material presented in the readings and during
  lecture.  Most readings will be accompanied by a short writing
  assignment to be completed either during or before the class
  meeting.  The details of these assignments will be provided as the
  course progresses.
<p>
  Frequently, readings outside of the text will be assigned on the
  course <a href="https://blackboard.longwood.edu/">Blackboard</a>
  site.  You are expected to have read and understood these additional
  readings before class.  Just like the readings from the text, you
  are responsible for the material in the additional readings even if
  they are not covered in lecture.
</p>

<h3>Lab</h3>
<p>
  Participation in the lab component of the course is mandatory.  You
  will be given a lab syllabus during the first meeting of the lab.

<h2>Classroom Policies</h2>
<h3>Attendance</h3>
<p>
  Your attendance and active participation in class activities is
  expected.  Education does not result due to the passive transfer of
  information from professor to student but rather from the active
  acquisition of information and understanding in a supportive
  environment.  I will work hard to provide you with the tools and
  environment you need to develop your understanding of environmental
  science and I will expect you to work hard to actively develop your
  understanding and facilitate the learning of your classmates.  As
  such, I expect much more than your simple presence in the class.
  In&ndash;class assignments cannot be made&ndash;up.
</p>
<h3>Expectations</h3>
<p>
  I will not tolerate any activities that show any level of disrespect
  toward other students, myself, or any other members of the Longwood
  or Farmville community.  
</p>
<p>
  I will expect professional conduct from all
  students at all times.  This includes paying attention when I, or
  other members of the class are speaking.  Cell phone use or computer
  use unrelated to classroom activities is not permitted. 
</p>
<p>
  It is extremely disruptive when students arrive late or leave
  early.  Please make sure you are on time and ready to work at the
  beginning of each class period.
</p>
<p> 
  All email correspondence with myself or any other members of
  community should adhere to the standards of professional
  communication and include an appropriate greeting, properly
  formatted grammar and spelling, and a salutation.  
</p>
<p>
  I expect that all members of the class will adhere to
  the <a href="http://www.longwood.edu/studentconduct/12021.htm">Longwood
  Honor Creed and Pledge</a> at all times.  If you are unclear on
  whether something is academically honest, be sure to ask.  No one
  will hold it against you if you try to clarify your understanding of
  academic integrity.
</p>
<h3>Correspondence</h3>
<p>
  All official correspondence for this course will occur through the
  <a href="https://blackboard.longwood.edu/webapps/login/">Blackboard
  Site</a> or through Longwood's email system. Please be sure to check
  both of these at least once a day for information regarding the
  class.
</p>
<p>
  I am available without an appointment during my office hours (listed
  above) and I will respond to emails within a timely manner during
  normal school operation hours.  If you cannot meet during any of the
  posted office hours, please email me to make an appointment.
</p>
<h3>Disabilities</h3>
<p>
  Any student who may need accommodations due to a physical,
  psychological, medical, or learning disability should contact the
  <a href="http://www.longwood.edu/disability/">Office for Disability
  Services (103 Graham Building, 395-2391)</a>. After you register for
  services, please contact me privately and we can discuss the needed
  accommodations.
