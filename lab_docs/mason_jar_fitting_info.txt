Hi Ken:
The vendor is swagelok.
In their vernacular, this is: O-seal straight thread male connector, 1/8
tube.  Part # is B-200-1-OR
The "B" means brass (can get them in a lot of different materials),
"200" means for 1/8, and I don't know what the rest means.  Good luck
and let me know if you need any more info.  Hi to Dina.
Regards Steve Whalen
