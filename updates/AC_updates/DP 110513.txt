*A lot more FPOM
*A lot more macroinvertebrates, snails, and fish (in number and variety)
*Most of the macroinvertebrates were found in the net instead of the bag; important to have net under bag ASAP
*Made sure to pick through the mesh bag for snails that would stick
*Some folded leaves had slimy patches
*Floats and bags started to congregate
*Lots of tulip poplar leaves along one side = more life & activity; also thicker mud
