# Update for Oct. 23 2013

### Accomplished

* Deployed leaf bags in Daulton Pond (DP) and Campus Pond (CP)
* Harvested handling control for DP and CP

### To Do

1. Deploy leaf bags in Lancer Park Pond (LPP)

2. Harvest bags for first sample date from DP and CP

3. Generate field notes/lab notes for DP and CP deployments

4. Plan bag harvest for all ponds

#### To Do Details

1. I think we will plan on deploying Lancer Park bags on Tuesday of next week (Oct 29) if we can get enough availability.  Now that we know what we are doing it should be easier and go faster.  So leading up to that we need to:

    1. Make leaf bags

    2. Make and tie floats

    3. Make rock bags 
  
2. The first harvest date for DP and CP is slated for Oct. 24, which is Thursday - it would be OK if we sample these anytime between Thursday and Friday (Oct. 24 - 25).  Please coordinate among each other to figure out when these harvests will take place.  I can walk you through the harvest protocol if you have questions.

3. We need to make sure that we document all of the data that we are collecting.  I wasn't as strict as I should have been about recording things in the notebook as we were doing it but as long as we generate the field notes while it is still fresh in our heads that should be OK.  

**Make sure you do a `git pull` in the `pond_diversity_fcn` directory before you make any changes to the files because I You can see examples of field notes on Github under
