### Accomplished

* Deployed leaf bags in Daulton Pond and Campus Pond
* Harvested handling control for DP and CP


The tasks that remain are:

1) Make leaf bags for Lancer Park
2) Deploy leaf bags in Lancer Park
3) Harvest bags from Daulton and Campus ponds
4) Generate field notes/lab notes for Daulton and Campus pond deployments

I think we will plan on deploying Lancer Park bags on Tuesday of next week (Oct 29) if we can get enough availability.  Now that we know what we are doing it should be easier and go faster.  So leading up to that we need to:
  1) Make leaf bags
