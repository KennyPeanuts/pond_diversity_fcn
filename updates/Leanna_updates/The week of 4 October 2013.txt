The week of 4 October 2013, I plan on collecting 5 bags from LPP. The collection process from LPP has been simple, and I have yet to run into problems. It has been noticed that there was a breakdown in leafs which has was documented in photographs that will be uploaded. In addition to the planed collection of bags, I am hoping to weigh the bags from last week. 

I have also read multiple articles on leaf decomposition, which will be pushed to my  update file.
