Update for 5 Nov 13
	Today I spent time to clean up the lab as previously suggested that needed to be done in last research meeting. After cleaning, I weighed all the bags that were in the dryer and put them into the lab journal; it was noticed that the recent bags have loss of approximately one gram. The bags of LPP will be pulled on Thursday at 9am.
